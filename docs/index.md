This is the page of the class where you will find the lectures in _printable format_ as well as in slide or presentation form. To print a page, go to the corresponding page you want to print on the left navigation menu and use standard file/print menu of your browser (or keyboard shortcuts `Command+P` or `Ctrl+P`).   
      
If you cannot visualize this page correctly from within Canvas, you can `open it in a new window or tab` using this link [https://kmlv.github.io/Econ100A/](https://kmlv.github.io/Econ100A/).

## Other relevant materials and sources

I recommend you open the following links in a new tab.
 
* Lazzati & Lopez Vargas' [Intermediate Microeconomics notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clykSpEGt9y_dnYVIgZaCQFet1q2z0_enbaRtg5_C-A/). Most likely this will require you to log into google with your UCSC account.   

* Kristian's Desmos Interactive graph example: [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gui6gng3mu](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gui6gng3mu)
 
* Intermediate Microeconomics Video Handbook.- This is a resource that can only be accessed via Canvas as it requires UCSC authentication.
 
* Makler's EconGraphs.org [https://www.econgraphs.org](https://www.econgraphs.org)
