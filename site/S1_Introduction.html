<h2>Why take this class?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Well, it is a requirement!</p></li>
<li><p>…more important: this course gives you tools to <em>understand better</em> how <em>consumers</em> and <em>firms</em> make decisions, and how prices are determined</p></li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Policy Analysis<br />
</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Life decisions</li>

<h2>Why take this class? (2)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>This course provides <strong>tools</strong> that economists use to assess the benefits and costs of possible courses of actions</p></li>
<li><p>This course will sharpen your <strong>reasoning</strong> to determine if a <strong>certain action is “optimal”</strong> (best)</p></li>
<li><p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do we increase the <strong>minimum wage</strong>? If so, by how much?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the optimal <strong>price for a product</strong>. Are we leaving money on the table?!</p></li>
<li><p>Is a company inefficiently <strong>allocating its resources</strong>, so that its costs are higher than they could be.</p></li>

I encourage you to review the (new) Academic Misconduct Policy for Undergraduates: http://www.ue.ucsc.edu/academic_misconduct</p></li>
<li><p>Special Accommodations due to Disability: Any student who thinks s/he is in need of accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to submit their Accommodation Authorization and discuss specific needs. Please do this preferably within the first two weeks of the quarter. Please contact the Disability Resource Center at 831-459-2089 in room 125 Hahn Student Services or by e-mail at drc@ucsc.edu to coordinate those accommodations.</p></li>

<h2>## Introduction</h2>
<h5 id="what-is-microeconomics">1.1 What is Microeconomics?</h5>
<p>In the standard definition, Microeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources.</p>
<p>However, to many economists (including us!) the most striking aspect of microeconomics is not the subject matter itself but the conceptual framework we use to approach the problem of study. Specifically, we —micro-economists— think of individuals and firms (or, more generally, economic agents) as intelligent seekers of specific goals and postulate that it is the pursuit of these goals what generates many of the important social phenomena we observe in daily life.</p>
<p>A standard situation we can study with the conceptual framework we use in Microeconomics is the functioning (and success) of ride-hailing apps such as UBER. (You can find here a podcast and here an academic article.) A bit more surprising is that we can use a similar methodology to evaluate, for instance, the possible impact of alternative policies to reduce crimes in NYC. (You can find here an article about this topic.)</p>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>##### 1.2 Conceptual Framework To explain the observed behavior of consumers and firms —or, more broadly speaking, economic agents— we rely on two simple principles.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Optimization</strong>: Agents choose the best (or most desirable) option among all the options that are available to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>For instance, in the standard consumer problem, we assume that each person purchases the most desirable basket of goods that he can afford with his income level.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong><em>Equilibrium</em></strong>: In a market context, prices keep adjusting until demand equals supply.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>To illustrate this concept, suppose that one day all tacos on campus are priced at $50. As you can imagine, there will be really few students and professors willing to pay that price! Thus, sellers would end up the day with a lot of unsold tacos. To avoid this situation, optimizing sellers will have incentives to lower their price in order to attract more taco customers. This process often iterates till sellers select a price at which the number of tacos made in a specific day roughly equates the number of tacos that consumers are willing to buy. We refer to the later as an equilibrium price.</td>

</table>
<h5 id="modeling-approach">1.3 Modeling Approach</h5>
<p>Reality can be very complex. Economic models help us to simplify it, so that we can just focus on the key, essential forces or features of the problems we are interested in.</p>
<p>A common analogy to economic models are maps. Though the geography of the world is quite rich, to figure out the best way to go from one specific city to a different one, we can abstract from many of its features and simply focus on basic diagrams. To explain the market price of a specific good, we often behave in the same way. We focus on the key determinants of its demand and supply and assume that other markets remain unchanged.</p>
