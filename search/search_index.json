Introduction 1.1 What is Microeconomics? In the standard definition, Microeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources. However, to many economists (including us!) the most striking aspect of microeconomics is not the subject matter itself but the conceptual framework we use to approach the problem of study. Specifically, we ---micro-economists--- think of individuals and firms (or, more generally, economic agents) as intelligent seekers of specific goals and postulate that it is the pursuit of these goals what generates many of the important social phenomena we observe in daily life. A standard situation we can study with the conceptual framework we use in Microeconomics is the functioning (and success) of ride-hailing apps such as UBER. (You can find here a podcast and here an academic article.) A bit more surprising is that we can use a similar methodology to evaluate, for instance, the possible impact of alternative policies to reduce crimes in NYC. (You can find here an article about this topic.) 1.2 Conceptual Framework To explain the observed behavior of consumers and firms ---or, more broadly speaking, economic agents--- we rely on two simple principles. Optimization : Agents choose the best (or most desirable) option among all the options that are available to them. For instance, in the standard consumer problem, we assume that each person purchases the most desirable basket of goods that he can afford with his income level. Equilibrium : In a market context, prices keep adjusting until demand equals supply. To illustrate this concept, suppose that one day all tacos on campus are priced at $50. As you can imagine, there will be really few students and professors willing to pay that price! Thus, sellers would end up the day with a lot of unsold tacos. To avoid this situation, optimizing sellers will have incentives to lower their price in order to attract more taco customers. This process often iterates till sellers select a price at which the number of tacos made in a specific day roughly equates the number of tacos that consumers are willing to buy. We refer to the later as an equilibrium price. 1.3 Modeling Approach Reality can be very complex. Economic models help us to simplify it, so that we can just focus on the key, essential forces or features of the problems we are interested in. A common analogy to economic models are maps. Though the geography of the world is quite rich, to figure out the best way to go from one specific city to a different one, we can abstract from many of its features and simply focus on basic diagrams. To explain the market price of a specific good, we often behave in the same way. We focus on the key determinants of its demand and supply and assume that other markets remain unchanged. 1.4 Mathematics as a Language In economics, we often use the mathematical language to express, develop and discuss our ideas. Mathematics helps us to precise our thoughts and avoid logical fallacies in our analysis.

Our simple model assumes that each consumer chooses the \u201cbest\u201d combination of goods ---or bundle--- that \u201che can afford\u201d. The idea of \u201cbest\u201d builds on the notions of preferences and utility; our model captures \u201caffordability\u201d via budget sets. Preferences : The preferences on an individual consist of his personal ranking over all possible alternatives. We often capture these preferences by the so called utility function. Budget Set : The budget set of an individual is the collection of all alternatives that he can afford given his resources (income or wealth) and the prices of the goods he faces in the market. Together, (1) and (2) induce choices. That is, they determine what consumption bundles are selected by the consumer. As prices and/or income change, so does the budget set and (often) the combination of goods that the consumer selects. The demand function describes the consumption decisions for all different combinations of prices and income levels. To simplify the exposition, we will focus on a simple version of the consumer problem. The components of our model are as follows: We assume there are only two goods: good 1 and good 2. We represent the quantities of these goods as $x_{1} and x_{2}$ , respectively. The ordered pair ($x_{1},x_{2}$) denotes a bundle of goods. The prices of the goods are represented by p\u2081 and p\u2082, respectively. The income level of the consumer is denoted by m . Example : Suppose good 1 is orange juice and good 2 is salad. Then $x_{1},x_{2}$ is the quantity of salads (say in pounds). In this context, the combination ($\\frac{1}{2}$ , 1) represents the bundle of half liter of orange juice and one pound of salad. Suppose also that a liter of orange juice costs 5 dollars, a pound of salad costs 10 dollars, and the income level of the consumer is 500 dollars. In our notation, this information is concisely written as $p_{1} = 5, p_{2} = 10$ , and m = 500. This simple two-goods model can be easily extended to more goods (e.g., it can be extended to the set of all goods you can get in the supermarket). We use the two-goods case because it helps us to illustrate the main concepts and tools in a simple way, often invoking a graphical representations of the model. Utility Function Consumer preferences represent a ranking over consumption bundles or combinations of different goods. For instance, if the consumer strictly prefers bundle $(x_{1}, x_{2}) = (1 pizza, 2 burritos)$ over bundle $(x_{1}',x_{2}') = (2 pizzas, 1 burritos)$ , then the first combination of goods is ranked before than the second one in the preferences of this consumer. We will always assume consumer preferences are transitive. Transitivity means that if a consumer prefers bundle a over bundle b, and he also prefers bundle b over bundle c , then it must be the case that the consumer prefers bundle a over bundle c Transitivity is a very important property as it allows us to talk of the most preferred bundle! When it holds, we can often conveniently represent the preferences of a given consumer by what we call a utility function. To do so, we also require the preferences to be continuous. Roughly speaking, \u201cpreferences are continuous\u201d if whenever an alternative A is preferred to an alternative B, any option A\u2019 that is sufficiently similar to option A is also preferred to option B. Formally, a utility function is a function that assigns a number to each bundle in such a way that these numbers respect the underlying preference ranking of the consumer (i.e., the utility function assigns higher numbers to more preferred combinations of goods). Example : : Let good 1 be pizza and good 2 be burrito. In addition, assume the preferences of a given consumer over slices of pizza and burritos are captured by the next utility function: $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ Suppose that a first bundle contains 16 slices of pizza and 1 burrito, so that u (16,1)=2. If a second bundle has 3 slices of pizzas and 3 burritos, then u (3,3)=3. It follows that this consumer prefers the second over the first combination of goods (i.e., he likes to have 3 slices of pizzas and 3 burritos more than having 16 slices of pizza and 1 burrito.) Though there are many types of utility functions, in this course we will mainly focus on three of them: Cobb-Douglas, Perfect Complements (i.e., Leontieff), and Perfect Substitutes (i.e., linear). We will sometimes also use the CES utility function. (CES stands for constant elasticity of substitution. We will clarify this term later.) The specific mathematical (functional) form of each of these utilities is given in the next table. - To do so, we also require the preferences to be continuous. Roughly speaking, \u201cpreferences are continuous\u201d if whenever an alternative A is preferred to an alternative B, any option A\u2019 that is sufficiently similar to option A is also preferred to option B. Utility Function Mathematical Form Perfect Substitutes $u(x_{1},x_{2})=ax_{1},ax_{2}$ Perfect Complements Cobb-Douglas $u(x_{1},x_{2})={(x_{1}^{a}), (x_{2}}^{b})$ CES $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(a{x_{1}}^{r}+b{x_{2}}^{r})^{1/r}$ In the first three cases we typically assume $a,b\\geq 0$ . In the last one, we let $r\\leq 1$ . As we shall see, these parameters play very different roles in each specification. As we explained earlier, the important aspect of a utility function is that it captures the underlying preferences of a specific consumer. According to the ordinal utility theory, it is meaningful to ask whether a bundle is better than a second one, but not how much better it is. In other words, the actual numbers that a utility function assigns to the specific bundles are not important as far as they preserve (respect) the ranking of the individual over the combination of goods. It follows that when the preferences of an individual can be represented by a utility function, then an infinite number of them can capture the same preferences! Example : Suppose that our previous consumer strictly prefers 16 slices of pizza and 1 burrito to 3 slices of pizzas and 3 burritos. In addition, he is indifferent between having 3 slices of pizzas and 3 burritos and 2 slices of pizzas and 4 burritos. Moreover, he strictly prefers 2 slices of pizzas and 4 burritos to having 2 slices of pizzas and 2 burritos. In summary, this consumer ranks the different combinations of goods as follows: $1^{st} (16,1) ; 2^{nd} (3,3) and (2,4) ; 3^{rd} (2,2)$ It follows that a utility function represents his preferences if and only if it assigns numbers to each combination of goods in the following way: $u(16,1) > u(3,3) = (2,4) > u (2,2)$ Let us now consider the three possible utility functions shown in the next table. Which of these three utilities represent the preferences we just described? Bundle Utility 1 Utility 2 Utility 3 (16,1) 8 12 4 (3,3) 7 9 2 (2,4) 6 9 2 (2,2) 3 2 -1 It is clear that Utility 1 does not do so. The reason is that it assigns to bundle 3,3 a higher number than to bundle 2,4, contradicting the fact that the consumer is indifferent between these two combinations of goods. On the other hand, even when Utility 2 and Utility 3 assign different numbers to the bundles, both of them are consistent with the preference ranking of the consumer. Therefore, Utility 2 and Utility 3 both represent this consumer\u2019s preferences. There are two concepts associated to the utility function, which play a key role in explaining consumer behavior, namely, indifference curves and marginal rate of substitution. We next elaborate on each of them. An indifference curve is the set of all bundles that a consumer regards as equally desirable. In other words, it is the set of all combination of goods that give the consumer the same utility level. We often assume that preferences satisfy a property that says more is always better. Under this monotonicity assumption, the indifference curves cannot be \u201cthick\u201d and they must be downward slopping. Weakly preferred sets also provide a convenient characterization of preferences. In terms of the utility function, a weakly preferred set is the sets of all bundles ($x_{1},x_{2}$) such that u($x_{1},x_{2}$) is at least as large as a specific value k . Example : Let $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$. Then, $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4} = k$ implicitly describes the set of all combinations of goods 1 and 2 that give the consumer a level k of utility. For each k, this set ---which can be also written as $x_{2}=k^{2}/x_{1}$ --- denotes a specific indifferent curve. We can get all the indifference curves by changing k In addition, for each k, the associated weakly preferred set is $x_{2}\\geq k^{4/3}/(x_{1})^{1/3}$ . The next figure shows the typical shape of the indifference curves for the case of Perfect Substitutes (top, left), Perfect Complements (top, right), Cobb-Douglas (bottom, left) and CES (bottom, right). You can find an interactive version of this figure here: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sh2hmdkie9 As we will explain, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is intimately related with the concept of marginal utility (MU). Thus, we start describing the latter. The marginal utility of good 1 captures the extra utility the consumer gets if he slightly increases the consumption of good 1, while keeping fixed the consumption of the second one. We can similarly define the marginal utility of good 2. When the utility function $u(x_{1},x_{2})$ is differentiable, then the marginal utilities of goods 1 and 2 (denoted by MU1 and MU2 ) are simply the partial derivatives of $u(x_{1},x_{2})$ with respect to goods 1 and 2, respectively. That is, $MU_{1}=\\partial u(x_{1},x_{2})/\\partial x_{1}$ and $MU_{2}=\\partial u(x_{1},x_{2})/\\partial x_{2}$ Example : Let [u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}]. Then, $MU_{1}(x_{1},x_{2})=\\frac{1}{4}(x_{1})^{-3/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ and $MU_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})=\\frac{3}{4}(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{-1/4}$ We showed before that two different utility functions might induce the same ranking over consumption bundles. These two utility functions represent the same preferences. As the next example illustrates, an issue with the concept of marginal utility is that it is sensitive to the way in which we represent consumer preferences. Example : Let us work with the same utility as in the previous example, $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$, except that now we multiply it by 4. That is, $u(x_{1},x_{2})=4(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$. Then, $MU_{1}(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{-3/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ and $MU_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})=3(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{-1/4}$ Since this utility is just $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ multiplied by 4, it represents the same ranking over consumption bundles as the utility of the previous example. Nevertheless, the two MUs are four times as large with $u(x_{1},x_{2})=4(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ as compared to $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ . Notice that the assumption of monotonicity implies that MUs are always positive. As we mentioned above, a second concept related to the utility function that is very important in economics is the marginal rate of substitution (MRS). The MRS is a measure of the relative value of good 1 in terms of good 2. In particular, it measures (approximately) of how much the consumer is willing to give up of good 2 in order to obtain an additional unit of good1. Mathematically, the MRS is given by the slope of an indifference curve (IC) at a given bundle. Therefore, it can be obtained as follows: Assuming that preferences are monotonic and can be represented by the utility function $u(x_{1},x_{2})$, we can think of an IC as a function $x_{2}(x_{1})$. Along this IC, we have: $u(x_{1},x_{2}(x_{1})) = k $ If we differentiate this function with respect to x1 (using the Chain Rule ), we get $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_{1}}(x_{1},x_{2})+[\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_{2}}(x_{1},x_{2})]\\frac{\\partial x_{2}}{x{1}}(x_{1}) =0$ Since the MRS is the slope of the IC, we get that $MRS = \\frac{\\partial x_{2}}{\\partial x_{1}}(x_{1}) = - MU_{1}/MU_{2}$ A very important property of the MRS is that (unlike the marginal utilities MUs) it is not affected by the way in which we measure preferences! Example : Let the utility function be either $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ or $u(x_{1},x_{2})=4(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$. In both cases, we have that $MRS(x_{1},x_{2})=-MU_{1}(x_{1},x_{2})/MU_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})=-x_{2}/3x_{1} $ In other words, the MRS remains the same for both utilities. When the utility function increases in the consumption of each good, then the MRS is negative. This means that if the consumer sacrifices a bit of one good, then he must be compensated with a bit more of the other good to be as well as before. In addition, we often assume that the MRS is decreasing (in absolute value). This captures the idea that the consumer prefers some sort of diversification across goods ---he prefers to have some of each good rather than having a lot of one good and nothing of the other. A decreasing MRS means that the more the consumer sacrifices of one good, the more he needs to be compensated with the other one to be as well as before. When this happens, we we say that consumer preferences are convex. Budget Set The budget set is the set of all bundles or combinations of goods that are affordable by the consumer. That is, the set of all ($x_{1},x_{2}$) that satisfy: $p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2}\\leq m$ where $p_{1}, p_{2}$ and m represent the price of good 1, the price of good 2, and the income level, respectively. The set of bundles that exhaust the income of the consumer is called the budget line: $p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2} = m$ In both cases, we also assume $x_{1}\\geq 10$ and $x_{2}\\geq 0$ In a graph where $x_{1}$ is represented along the horizontal axis, and $x_{2}$ along the vertical axis, the slope of the budget line is given by $-p_{1}/p_{2}.$ Notice that the maximum amount of good 1 that the consumer can purchase is given by the intercept of the budget line with the horizontal axis, and its magnitude is $m/p_{1}$. Similarly, for good 2, this magnitude is $m/p_{2}$. The next picture shows the budget set and line for the case of $p_{1}$ = 2, $p_{2}$ = 2 and m = 40. Example : Suppose the government imposes a per unit tax of t dollars on good 2. Then, the new budget line is $p_{1}x_{1}+(p_{2}+t)x_{2}=m.$ Notice that the tax reduces the number of units the consumer can afford of both goods 1 and 2. This happens even while the tax only affects the price of good 2. Optimal Choice We have discussed both consumer\u2019s preferences (captured by his utility function) and consumption restrictions (captured by his budget set). To characterize consumer behavior ---that is, to explain the bundle that he will acquire in the market for each combination of prices and income level--- we assume the consumer behaves in an optimal way. In words, we postulate that the consumer selects the most desirable bundle out of the ones that he can actually afford. Mathematically, this implies that the consumer solves the following problem: $max_{x_{1}, x_{2}}\\left \\{ u(x_{1},x_{2}): p_{1}x_{1}+p_{1}x_{2} = m \\right \\}$ We start with a graphical explanation for the solution of the consumer problem. The next figure shows the case of a consumer with income level m=40 , who faces prices $p_{1}=2$ and $p_{2}=2$. Thus, his budget set is $2x_{1}+2x_{2}\\leq 40$ , which is illustrated in the shaded triangular area. Suppose that the utility function of this consumer has a Cobb-Douglas specification $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{3/4}(x_{2})^{1/4}$. The left panel of the figure also shows four ICs corresponding to the following different utility levels: $k_{1}=6, k_{2}=9, k_{3}=11.39$ and $k_{4}=15$ . As it is readily verified, the further away from the origin, the higher the utility level of the consumer. Recall that we assume the consumer acquires the most desirable combination of goods among the ones that he can afford. This consumer can definitely get a utility level of 6 ---since there are some affordable bundles (under the shaded area) that provide this level of satisfaction. The same applies to a utility of level of 9. Notice that this is not true for a utility of level 15 ---since there is no affordable bundle that provides the consumer this level of satisfaction. It turns out that, in this example, the highest achievable utility level is $k_{3}=5^{1/4}15^{3/4}\\simeq 11.39$ , with the optimal consumption bundle being (5,15). notice that we have chosen to draw only four out of an infinite number of possible indifference curves It follows from our simple example that the best affordable combination of goods is the one that belongs to the highest IC that just touches ---usually in only one point--- the budget constraint. We now present the mathematical solution of the consumer problem for three of the most commonly used utility functions. Optimal Choice with Cobb-Douglas Preferences The consumer problem with Cobb-Douglas preferences is given by $max_{x_{1},x_{2}} \\left \\{ x_{1}^{a} x_{2}^{b} : p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2} = m\\right \\}$ To find the optimal bundle when preferences are Cobb-Douglas (C-D), we use the Lagrangian method. The associated Lagrangian function is $L(x_{1},x_{2},\\lambda )={x_{1}^{a}x_{2}^{b}-\\lambda (p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2}-m)}$ Recall that we can get the solution of our initial problem by finding the maximizers of the Lagrangian function. The first order conditions of our problem (FOCs) are: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_{1}}=ax_{1}^{a-1}x_{2}^{b}-\\lambda p_{1} = 0$ (FOC1) $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_{2}}=bx_{1}^{a}x_{2}^{b-1}-\\lambda p_{2} = 0$ (FOC2) $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda }=-p_{1}x_{1}-p_{2}x_{2}+m = 0$ (FOC3) To find the optimal consumption bundle, we need to find the $x_{1}, x_{2}$, and $\\lambda$ that solve this system of three equations and three unknowns (as a function of $p_{1}, p_{2}$ and m ). We can solve this system of equations by first obtaining an expression for $\\lambda$ from both FOC1 and FOC2, and then make these two terms equal to each other. Doing so we get: $\\frac{ax_{1}^{a-1}x_{2}^{b}}{p_{1}} =\\frac{bx_{2}^{b-1}x_{1}^{a}}{p_{2}}$ This expression simplifies to: $\\frac{ax_{2}}{bx_{1}}= \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ Combining this last result with FOC3, we finally get: $x_{1}* = \\frac{a}{a+b}\\frac{m}{p_{1}}$ | $x_{2}* = \\frac{b}{a+b}\\frac{m}{p_{2}}$ To find $\\lambda$ * , we can simply plug $x_{1}$ * and $x_{2}$ * into either FOC1 or FOC2. It follows from our previous results, that the optimal solution satisfies $MRS = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ and $m = p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2}$ The first condition states that the relative value of the goods from the perspective of the consumer has to equal their relative value from the perspective of the market. The second condition simply states that the optimal bundle must be on the budget line. Example : Let us assume that $u(x_{1},x_{2})=x_{1}^{a} x_{2}^{b}$ with a = \u00bc, b = \u00be, m = 40, $p_{1} = 2$ and $p_{2} = 2$. Thus, the Lagrangian of the problem is: $L (x_{1},x_{2},\\lambda ) = x_{1}^{1/4}x_{2}^{3/4}-\\lambda (2x_{1}+2x_{2}-40)$ Taking the partial derivatives wrt $x_{1} x_{2}$ and $\\lambda$, we get: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_{1}}=(1/4)x_{1}^{1/4-1}x_{2}^{3/4}-\\lambda 2 = 0$ (FOC1) $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_{2}}=(3/4)x_{2}^{3/4-1}x_{1}^{1/4}-\\lambda 2 = 0$ (FOC2) $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda }= 40 - 2x_{1}-2x_{2} = 0$ (FOC3) To find the optimal $x_{1} and x_{2}$, we first get $\\lambda$ from FOC1 and FOC2 and then make these two terms equal to each other: $\\frac{1/4x_{1}^{-3/4}x_{2}^{3/4}}{2} = \\frac{3/4x_{2}^{-1/4}x_{1}^{1/4}}{2}$ This expression simplifies to: $\\frac{x_{2}}{3x_{1}}=\\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ Combining the latter with FOC3, we solve for $x_{1} and x_{2}$ and obtain $x_{1}* =( \\frac{1}{4}) (\\frac{40}{2}) = 5$ and $x_{2}* =( \\frac{3}{4}) (\\frac{40}{2}) = 15$ Optimal Choice with Perfect Substitutes Preferences When the goods are perfect substitutes from the perspective of the consumer, then we cannot use the Lagrangian method to obtain the optimal bundle. The reason is that, in this case, the solution is usually non-interior. We next explain how to approach the consumer problem in this case. The consumer problem with perfect substitute preferences is given by: $max_{x_{1},x_{2}}\\left \\{ ax_{1}+bx_{2}: p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} = m \\right \\}$ In this case, the MRS between the goods is given by: $MRS = \\frac{\\partial u/ \\partial x_{1}}{\\partial u/ \\partial x_{2}} = \\frac{a}{b}$ Recall that the MRS defines the relative value of good 1 in terms of good 2 from the perspective of the consumer. With perfect substitute preferences, the MRS is just a constant. On the other hand, the ratio $\\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ describes the relative market valuation of good 1 in terms of good 2. In the case of perfect substitutes, the optimal choice relies on the comparison between the MRS and the ratio of prices. Case 1: If $MRS = \\frac{a}{b} > \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ then $x_{1}$ * = $\\frac{m}{p_{1}}$ and $x_{2}$ * = 0 Case 2: If $MRS = \\frac{a}{b} < \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ then $x_{1}$ * = 0 and $x_{2}$ * = $\\frac{m}{p_{2}}$ Case 3: If $MRS = \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ then $x_{1}$ * $\\in [0, \\frac{m}{p_{1}}]$ and $x_{2}$ * $\\in [0, \\frac{m}{p_{2}}]$ such that $x_{1}$ * + $x_{2}$ * = m To understand the first case, notice that $\\frac{a}{b} > \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ means that the extra value of the first good as compared to the second one from the perspective of the consumer is higher than the extra cost of getting the first good as compared to getting the second one. Thus, it is convenient for this person to spend all his income in the first good. Case 2 has a similar explanation. Case 3 corresponds to a situation in which the MRS equals the relative prices; in this last case, the consumer is indifferent between spending all, some, or no money in good 1 as far as he spends the rest of his income in the other good Example : Suppose a =1.5 and b =1. Then, MRS =1.5. This means that this consumer is willing to give up to 1.5 units of good 2 for an additional unit of good 1. On the other hand, let us assume that $p_{1}$=2, $p_{2}$=2 and m=40. Thus, the relative market value of good 1 in terms of good 2 is just 1, i.e., $\\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}} = 1$. Given that $MRS = 1.5 > 1 = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ regardless the bundle selected, we are in Case 1 above. Thus, it is optimal for the consumer to spend all his income in good 1. That is, $x_{1}$ * = $\\frac{m}{p_{1}}=\\frac{40}{2} = 20$ and $x_{2}$ * = 0 The next figure illustrates this solution: Optimal Choice with Perfect Complement Preferences Remember that the utility function for perfect complement preferences is given by $u(x_{1}x_{2})=min\\left \\{ \\frac{x_{1}}{a},\\frac{x_{2}}{b} \\right \\}$ As with the case of perfect substitutes, when the goods are perfect complements from the perspective of the consumer, then we cannot use the Lagrangian method to obtain the optimal bundle. In this case, the reason is that the corresponding utility function is not differentiable. The consumer problem with perfect complements utility function is given by $max_{x_{1},x_{2}}\\left \\{ min\\left \\{ \\frac{x_{1}}{a}, \\frac{x_{2}}{b} \\right \\} : p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} = m \\right \\}$ Notice that, in this case, as long as $p_{1}, p_{2}$, a and b are all strictly positive, the optimal bundle will always satisfy: $\\frac{x_{1}}{a} =\\frac{x_{2}}{b}$ The reason is quite simple. Suppose that instead we have $\\frac{x_{2}}{b} > \\frac{x_{1}}{a}$ . Then, $x_{2}/b>x_{1}/a=u(x_{1},x_{2})=min\\left \\{ \\frac{x_{1}}{a}, \\frac{x_{2}}{b} \\right \\}$ It follows that this consumer could be strictly better off by spending a bit less in the second good and using that money to get a bit more of the first good! This process repeats till $x_{1}/a = x_{2}/b$ . (A similar idea applies when $x_{1}/a > x_{2}/b$ .) In addition, we know that the optimal bundle must satisfy the budget constraint. That is, $p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} = m$ Combining our two observations, we get: $p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}\\frac{bx_1}{a} = m$ So that $x_{1}$ * = $\\frac{ma}{(ap_{1}+bp_{2})}$ . In a similar way, we get that $x_{2}$ * = $\\frac{mb}{(ap_{1}+bp_{2})}$ Example: Let us assume $u(x_{1}, x_{2}) = min( \\frac{x_{1}}{a}, \\frac{x_{2}}{b} )$ with a=1, b=1, $p_{1}$=2, $p_{2}$=2, and m=40. In this case, we know that the optimal consumption of good 1 and 2 must satisfy: $x_{1} = x_{2}$ We also know that: $2x_{1} + 2x_{2} = 40$ Using these two equations, we get that: $x_{1}$ * = $\\frac{ma}{(ap_{1}+bp_{2})} = \\frac{40}{2+2} = 10$ and $x_{2} * = \\frac{mb}{(ap_{1}+bp_{2})} = \\frac{40}{2+2} = 10$ The next figure illustrates this solution. Solution for the perfect complements. Note 1: Income Tax vs Sale Tax. We study choices and welfare implications under two tax specifications that provide the same income level for the government. 2.2 Demand Function Individual Demand Function We explained earlier that the consumer problem consists of selecting the most preferred bundle among the ones that the consumer can afford. Mathematically, the problem was described as follows $max_{x_{1},x_{2}}\\left \\{ u(x_{1},x_{2}) : p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} = m \\right \\}$ The solution of this problem consists of a pair x1 and x2 . We typically write this choice as: $x_{1}$ * = $x_{1}(p_{1},p_{2},m)$ and $x_{2}$ * = $x_{2}(p_{1},p_{2},m)$ to highlight the fact that the optimal amounts of good 1 and good 2 depend on the prices of the goods and the income level of the consumer. In other words, optimal choices are function of $p_{1}, p_{2}$ and m . We refer to them as the individual demand functions. The demand function of good i (with i =1,2) receives different names according to the way in which it responds to changes in each of its arguments. (In economics, we often call this exercise comparative statics.) We next describe the main relationships. Changes with respect to income: If $x_{i}(p_{1}\u2022p_{2},m)$ increases with m, we say the good is normal. If $x_{i}(p_{1}\u2022p_{2},m)$ decreases with m, we say the good is inferior. Changes with respect to own price: If $x_{i}(p_{1}\u2022p_{2},m)$ decreases with $p_{i}$, we say the good is ordinary. If $x_{i}(p_{1}\u2022p_{2},m)$ increases with $p_{i}$, we say the good is Giffen. Changes with respect to the price of the other good: If $x_{i}(p_{1}\u2022p_{2},m)$ increases with $p_{j}$, we say the goods are substitute. If $x_{i}(p_{1}\u2022p_{2},m)$ decreases with $p_{j}$, we say the goods are complement. Out of all these possibilities, Giffen goods are probably the less frequently observed. Jensen and Miller (AER, 2008) provided the first real-world evidence of Giffen behavior, i.e., a good with upward-sloping demand. The authors found this behavior when studying rice subsidies for poor households in Hunan and Gansu, China. Example : Let the utility be $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ . We showed before that, in this case, $x_{1}$ * = $x_{1}(p_{1}p_{2},m)=\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{m}{p_{1}}$ and $x_{2}$ * = $x_{2}(p_{1}p_{2},m)=\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{m}{p_{2}}$ Thus, according to our previous definitions, both goods are normal and ordinary. Since the quantity demanded of one of them does not depend on the price of the other one, we also say that they are independent. The next figures provide a graphical representation of the our comparative statics results. Own price changes: Income Changes: Our previous classifications of the goods seem to suggest that about any change in consumption is possible as prices and income levels change. Thus, one immediately wonders: Does our theory generate any testable implication? We will show that the answer is yes. This is important as, otherwise, our theory of consumer choice could never be proven false! The testable implication of our theory receives the name of Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences (WARP) . This basic result is quite simple. If a bundle is acquired, then it must be the case that the consumer prefers this combination of goods to all other affordable ones. In other words, via choices, the consumer is providing us some information regarding his preferences. By testing WARP we make sure that consumer\u2019s choices don\u2019t provide contradicting information. The next example illustrates this possibility. Example : Imagine that we observe the next choices Price of good 1 Price of good 2 Income Choice of good 1 Choice of good 2 $p_{1} = 2$ $p_{2} = 1$ m = 10 $x_{1}$ * = 4 $x_{2}$ * = 2 p1 = 1 p2 = 1 m = 8 $x_{1}$ * = 1 $x_{2}$ * = 7 We are interested in the next question: Could these choices have been made by a utility maximizer? The answer is no. The reason is as follows. When the prices and income level were given by $p_{1}=2, p_{2}=1$, and m=10, the consumer selected 4 units of good 1 and 2 units of good 2. Notice that, since 2 x 1 + 1 x 7 < 10, he could have selected to consume 1 unit of good 1 and 7 units of good 2. This is telling us that this consumer strictly prefers bundle (4, 2) to bundle (1, 7). Alternatively, when the prices and income level of the consumer were given by $p_{1}=1, p_{2}=1$, and m=8, he selected 1 unit of good 1 and 7 units of good 2. Notice that, since 1 x 4 + 1 x 2 < 8, he could have selected to consume 4 units of good 1 and 2 units of good 2. Thus, this consumer strictly prefers bundle (1, 7) to bundle (4, 2) which contradicts our previous claim. The WARP simply formalizes our observations in the last example. Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference (WARP) : Suppose that $(x_{1},x_{2})$ is selected when the prices are $(p_{1},p_{2})$, and $(x_{1}',x_{2}')$ is chosen when the prices are $(p{1}',p{2}')$. If $p_{1}x_{1}' + p_{2}x_{2}' \\leq p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2}$, then it must be that $p_{1}'x_{1} + p_{2}'x_{2} > p_{1}'x_{1}'+p_{2}'x_{2}'.$ In words, WARP is telling us that if $(x_{1},x_{2})$ was selected when $(x_{1}',x_{2}')$ was affordable, then it cannot be the case that $(x_{1},x_{2})$ was affordable when the consumer selected $(x_{1}',x_{2}').$ The next figure displays the three key cases to check whether WARP is satisfied or not. Using our previous definition, it is easy to see that the only violation happens in panel (a). Redo Note 1 without assuming any particular functional form for the utility function. Echenique et. al (2010) uses US data for purchasing decisions in the supermarket to check whether people behave according to our model. While they find some violations, they prove that they are not that severe. They also relate the strength of the violations with people characteristics. Among other results, they find that older people behave closer to the model. Market Demand Function We just learned that the individual demand function of good i , with i =1,2, represents the choice of good i in the bundle that maximizes the utility of the consumer for each pair of prices and income level. If we refer to an arbitrary consumer as consumer j, then $x_{1}^{j} (p_{1}, p_{2}, m^{j})$ and $x_{2}^{j} (p_{1}, p_{2}, m^{j})$ indicate consumer j 's demands for goods 1 and 2, respectively. The market demands for these goods are given by $Q_{1}^{d}(p_{1}, p_{2}, m^{1}, m_{2}, ...., m^{J}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J}x_{1}^{j}(p_{1}, p_{2}, m^{j})$ $Q_{2}^{d}(p_{1}, p_{2}, m^{1}, m_{2}, ...., m^{J}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J}x_{2}^{j}(p_{1}, p_{2}, m^{j})$ where J indicates the number of consumers in the economy. That is, for each fixed vector of prices and income levels, the market demand of each good is simply the sum of the individual market demands of all consumers in the economy for that specific good. Notice that the market demand of each good depends on the prices of the two goods as well as the income distribution. We just derived the quantity demanded for each good as a function of the market prices. It is sometimes convenient to express market prices as functions of quantities. We refer to P(x) as the inverse demand function of a certain good. Example : Suppose that the economy consists of two individuals with demand functions given by $x^{1}(p, m^{1}) = 20 - p$ and $x^{2} (p,m^{2}) = 30-3p$ The aggregate demand function is thereby given by $Q^{d}(p, m^{1}, m^{2}) = x^{1}(p,m^{1})+x^{2}(p,m^{1}) = 50 - 4p$ if $p\\leq 10$ $Q^{d}(p, m^{1}, m^{2}) = x^{1}(p,m^{1})+x^{2}(p,m^{1}) = 20 - p$ if $p > 10$ Note that we add quantities for the same price! The next picture illustrates this result. When demands are linear, then there is usually a kink in the market demand. In this example, the inverse demand function is given by $p(Q, m^{1}, m^{2}) = 12.5 - \\frac{1}{4}Q$ if $Q \\geq 10$ $p(Q, m^{1}, m^{2}) = 20- Q$ if $Q < 10$ Let $Q^{d}(p)$ be the demand function. The elasticity of demand is given by $\\varepsilon = (\\partial Q^{d}(p)/\\partial p)(p/Q^{d}(p))$ Since, generally, $\\partial Q^{d} (p)/\\partial p \\leq 0$ , we often express $\\varepsilon $ in absolute values. The elasticity of demand measures how sensitive is the demand function to price changes. When $|\\varepsilon |$>1, we say the demand is elastic. This means that the quantity demanded is very responsive to price changes. It usually happens when the good we are considering has close substitutes. For example, A4 paper from Office World and A4 paper from Boise. When $|\\varepsilon |$<1, we say the demand is inelastic. This means that the quantity demanded does not respond very much to changes in prices. It usually happens when the good does not have close substitutes. For example, some medications, like Triluma. Example: Let $Q^{d}(p) = a-bp$ . The elasticity of demand is $|\\varepsilon| = bp/(a-bp)$ The next picture shows the way in which $|\\varepsilon |$ varies with x. Notice that the good is elastic or inelastic according to the amount that the consumer gets. 2.3 Intertemporal Choice The model we studied in the last section assumes that either there is a single period of time or that the consumer spends all his income every period, without saving or borrowing. This section shows that a similar approach can be used to model consumer behavior across different periods of time. This extension will allow us to understand the relationship between saving (or borrowing) and the interest rate. It is also important as it shows that, with small modifications, our initial model can accommodate many situations of interest. In our simple intertemporal choice model, consumers decide how to allocate their income between consumption today and tomorrow. The main components of the model are as follows. Two goods: current consumption $(c_{1})$ and future consumption $(c_{2})$ Prices of current and future consumption is 1 (i.e., we assume no inflation) Income levels: current income $(m_{1})$ and future income $(m_{1})$ Interest rate: r As you can see, we make a few simplifying assumptions. First, we assume that there is no inflation. Second, we assume there is a bank that allows the consumer to either save his current income $(m_{1})$ or to borrow up from his future income $(m_{2})$. Moreover, we suppose that the interest rate r is the same for saving and borrowing money. (These restrictions can be easily relaxed with small, though probably tedious, modifications of our main results.) In the intertemporal model, consumers\u2019 preferences are captured by a utility function over current and future consumption $u(c_{1},c_{2})$ Because we are allowing the consumer to either save or borrow money, the consumer faces a single budget constraint for the \u201cwhole life\u201d ---or two periods. Expressed in future value, the lifetime income of this person is 1+rm1+m2. To understand better this equation, notice that 1+r represents the extra income the consumer can experience in the second period per dollar that he saves in the first period of time. If in period of time 1 the consumer puts 1 dollar of his income in the bank, then in the second period the bank gives the consumer the dollar he invested plus the interest rate r. Similarly, her lifetime consumption is 1+rc1+c2. His budget constraint simply reflects that these two amounts must be the same. That is, $(1+r)c_{1} + c_{2} = (1+r)m_{1} + m_{2}$ Notice that, in a graph where $c_{1}$ is in the horizontal axis and $c_{2}$ is in the vertical axis, the slope of the budget line is -(1+r). We can also write the budget line in present value terms $c_{1}+c_{2}/(1+r) = m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+r)$ In this representation, 1/(1+r) indicates how much more the consumer can buy in period of time 1 if he sacrifices 1 unit of consumption in period 2. To achieve this goal, the consumer borrows 1/(1+r) dollars from the bank in the first period of time with the promise of paying [1/(1+r)] x (1+r) =1 to the bank in period of time 2. The (intertemporal) problem of the consumer is as follows: $max_{c{1},c{2}}\\left \\{ u(c_{1},c_{2}) : (1+r) c_{1}+c_{2}=(1+r)m_{1}+m_{2}\\right \\}$ Notice that, from a mathematical perspective, this problem is very similar to our initial consumer choice model! Moreover, it is indeed identical if we let $x_{1}=c_{1}$ and $x_{2}=c_{2}$ $p_{1}=1+r$ and $p_{2}=1$ $m = (1+r)m_{1}+m_{2}$ Example: As we just described, we assume no inflation and indicate by $m_{1}, m_{2}$, and r the corresponding income levels and interest rate. In this example, we will also suppose the consumer has the following utility specification for consumption in periods 1 and 2 $u(c_{1},c_{2}) = (c_{1})^{1/4}(c_{2})^{3/4}$ The problem of the consumer is $max_{c{1},c{2}}\\left \\{ (c_{1})^{1/4}(c_{2})^{3/4} : (1+r) c_{1} + c_{2} = (1+r) m_{1} + m_{2}\\right \\}$ Given the connection we just established between this model and the initial consumer problem, we can use our previous results to state that $c_{1}$ * = $\\frac{1}{4} [(1+r)m_{1}+m_{2}][1/(1+r)]$ and $c_{2}$ *= $\\frac{3}{4} [(1+r)m_{1}+m_{2}]$ **Note 2: Revealed Preferences and the Interest Rate.(( In this note we study the effect of increasing the interest rate for a \"saver\" and a \"borrower\" consumer. We just studied the optimal allocation of consumption levels between today and tomorrow. Let us next assume that our intertemporal consumer faces the possibility of investing some amount of money today with the promise of receiving some specific return tomorrow. Should the consumer make such an investment? We now develop a criterion which the consumer should use in deciding whether or not to do so. To be more clear, let us consider an investment which has a negative cash flow of - dollar A today ---the investment--- and a positive cashflow of dollar B in 1 year ---the return. The question we want to address is Should the person invest in this project? The answer to this question is indeed very simple. The person should invest if (and only if) $-A + B/(1+r) \\geq 0$ (Positive Net Present Value in Finance.) The reason is that if $-A + B/(1+r) \\geq 0$ , then the budget line of the consumer shifts up. Notice that the previous rule does not depend on the preferences of the consumer! Note 3: Investment on Schooling. We study investment on schooling with and without borrowing constraints Note 4: Choosing a Retirement Plan. We study the selection of two different retirement plans. 2.4 Choice Under Risk In this section, we study individual behavior with respect to choices involving risk. We face risks in almost every single decision we make since, in most cases, it is hard to anticipate the exact consequences of each alternative. Let\u2019s start with an example. As an economics professor at UC Berkeley, Gary Becker had to give an exam at 8:00 AM. He arrived at the university at 7:55 AM, so he did not have enough time to go to the parking lot and be on time for the test. He faced two options: go to the parking lot, so to avoid the parking ticket, but be late for the exam with certainty; or park in front of the Economics Department, so to be be on time for the exam, but face the risk of getting a parking ticket. As you can see, each option has pros and cons. The question is how to compare them! To do so we need a model that would allow us to compare options in which we are not sure about the final outcomes. We next present the most commonly used method. In economics, we typically use the framework of Expected Utility (EU). In this approach, every possible outcome has a utility level associated to it. In this example, u(late, no penalty) would denote the utility that Gary Becker gets from option (1). Under option (2), there are two possibilities, he either gets caught or he doesn't. Let u(on time, penalty) and u(on time, no penalty) indicate the utility levels under these two possible outcomes of option (2). Also, suppose that he estimates that if he parks in front of the Economics Department, then the probability of getting caught is p . According to the expected utility approach, Gary Becker values the risky alternative as a weighted combination of the utilities he could experience in that course of action. Following that logic he should decide to be late if and only if: u(late, no penalty)>p u(on time, penalty)+(1-p)u(on time,no penalty) Otherwise, he should choose to \u201cbreak the law\u201d, and park in front of the Econ Department. This example is given by Gary Becker as the starting point of his economic analysis of criminal decisions. More generally, the expected utility model assumes that the utility a person gets from each risky choice depends on (i) the utility of the different outcomes the individual might face; and (ii) the probability of each of these possible outcomes. In particular, the valuation of a risky choice in the expected utility model is as follows: $EU=p_{1}u(c_{1})+p_{2}u(c_{2})$ where $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are two possible outcomes usually measured in monetary terms (for example $1 and $10), and $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are their corresponding probabilities (for example \u2153 and \u2154, respectively). Under this specification, the overall utility is just the weighted average of the utility that the person gets under each possible circumstance, where the weights are the probabilities that the person assigns to the different events. As we mentioned earlier, though the expected utility approach is probably the most widely utilized method, it is not the only model that has been used to study choice under risk. The field of behavioral economics studies other conceptual approaches, among which the prospect theory by Tversky and Kahneman (1979) is probably the most prominent one. In what follows, we will only consider situations where the different outcomes of the risky choice are simply different amounts of money. In that sense, we will restrict attention to situations that are similar to the ones that consumers face when they buy lottery tickets or go to the casino. Example : (Lottery) An individual has 100 dollars in his wallet and is evaluating whether to buy a lottery ticket. The ticket costs 20 dollars and he knows that with 50% chance he can get 40 dollars, and with 50% chance he gets 0 dollars. In our notation, $c_{1}=100-20+40=120$, $c_{2}=100-20=80$, $p_{1}=0.5$ and $p_{2}=0.5$. Let us also assume, the utility function of this person is given by: $u(c_{i})=c_{i}^{1/2}$ where c_{i} is the money that the consumer gets in each outcome i . Under this specification, if the person buys the ticket, his expected utility (denoted by EU ) is given by: Expected Utility of the Lottery Ticket (EU) = $\\frac{1}{2}u(100-20+40) + \\frac{1}{2}u(100-20)$ = $\\frac{1}{2}(120)^{1/2}+ \\frac{1}{2}(80)^{1/2}$ $\\approx$ 9.95 On the other hand, if the individual does not get the ticket, his utility is $u(100)=(100)^{1/2}=10$, with certainty. Since 10 > 9.95, this consumer will rather prefer not to buy the ticket for the lottery. \u25a0 It is important to notice that the expected value of buying the ticket in the previous example is $\\frac{1}{2} (100-20+40) + \\frac{1}{2}(100-20) = 100$ That is, it the same as not buying the ticket. Yet, this consumer preferred to avoid taking the risk involved in the lottery. The next example shows the key role that the shape of the utility function has in determining whether a person takes or not a specific risk. Example : (Investment) An individual is contemplating the possibility of either investing his money in a risky project that pays 36 dollars if he wins and 0 dollars otherwise or in a safe project that always pays 18 dollars. He estimates that the probability of winning in the risky project is \u00bd. That is, $c_{1}=36, c_{2}=0, p_{1}=0.5$ and $p_{2}=0.5.$ We are interested in a simple question: Should a rational person invest in the risky project? We next show that the answer of this question depends on the preferences of the individual, which are captured by the shape of the utility function u. If the person gets involved in the risky project, then his expected utility is EU[ risky project ]=$\\frac{1}{2}u(36)+\\frac{1}{2}u(0)$ Since the safe option always pays $18, he should invest in the risky project whenever EU[ risky project ]=$\\frac{1}{2}u(36)+\\frac{1}{2}u(0)\\geq u(18)$ Otherwise, this person would be better off putting his money in the safe option. Without any other information regarding the shape of u , we cannot answer our initial question. We next contemplate three different possibilities. Let us assume first that $u(c_{i})=(c_{i})^{1/2}$. In this case, the expected utility of the risky project is EU[ risky project ]=$\\frac{1}{2}u(36)+\\frac{1}{2}u(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(36)^{1/2}+\\frac{1}{2}(0)^{1/2} = 3$ In addition, the utility he gets from the safe project is $(18)^{1/2} \\approx 4.24$. Since EU[ risky project ]= $\\frac{1}{2}(36)^{1/2}+\\frac{1}{2}(0)^{1/2} = 3 < 4.24$ we conclude that this person should select the safe option. The following picture illustrates this first situation. Note: You can access an interactive version of this graph here . Let us now suppose that $u(c_{i}=c){i}$. In this case, we have that EU[ risky project ]= $\\frac{1}{2}u(36)+\\frac{1}{2}u(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(36)+ \\frac{1}{2}(0)$ In addition, the utility from the safe project is (18)=18. Thus, this person is just indifferent between the safe and the risky option. Finally, let us set $u(c_{i}=(c_{i})^{2}$. In this case, we have that EU[ risky project ]= $ \\frac{1}{2}u(36)+ \\frac{1}{2}u(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(36)^{2}+ \\frac{1}{2}(0)^{2}=648$ In addition, the utility from the safe project is u(18)=(18)^{2}=324. Thus, this person clearly prefers the risky investment. We often classify individuals according to their attitudes toward risk. As we shall see, the standard classification is intimately related to our last example. It involves the comparison between the expected utility of the risky project $p_{1}u(c_{1})+p_{2}u(c_{2})$ and the utility of the person evaluated at the expected value of the risky project $u(p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2})$ The expected value of the risky project ---$p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2}$---- can be thought as the amount of money that a person who invests in the risky project many times would get on average. The next table classifies people according to attitudes toward risk and establishes a connection between these attitudes and the curvature of the utility function. Attitude/Behavior Shape of utility function Property of utility function Risk Averse Concave Utility $p_{1}u(c_{1})+p_{2}u(c_{2})\\leq u(p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2})$ Risk Neutral Linear Utility $p_{1}u(c_{1})+p_{2}u(c_{2})= u(p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2})$ Risk Loving Convex Utility $p_{1}u(c_{1})+p_{2}u(c_{2})> u(p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2})$ Example : Suppose that, as in the last example, an individual is contemplating the possibility of either investing his money in a risky project that pays 36 dollars if he wins and 0 dollars otherwise or in a safe project that always pays 18 dollars. The probability of winning in the risky project is again 1/2. In the previous example we studied the investment decision of three individuals that differed regarding the shape of the utility function: We found that the first individual would not invest, the second one was indifferent, and the third one would always invest in the risky project. Given our last table, we could have made the prediction without any calculation! The reason is that the expected value of the risky project was given by $\\frac{1}{2}36+\\frac{1}{2}0=18$ This is the same as the money the individual makes with the safe investment. In addition, $u(c_{i})=(c_{i})^{1/2}$ is a concave function, $u(c_{i})=c_{i}$ is a linear function, and $u(c_{i})=(c_{i})^{2}$ is a convex function.","title":"Consumer Choice (Chapter 2)"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#consumer-choice-chapter-2","text":"","title":"Consumer Choice (Chapter 2)"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#intermediate-microeconomics-econ-100-a","text":"","title":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100 A)"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#natalia-lazzati","text":"","title":"Natalia Lazzati"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#ucsc-winter-2019","text":"","title":"UCSC - Winter 2019"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#consumer-choice","text":"This section presents some standard economic models of consumer behavior.","title":"Consumer Choice"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#21-rational-choice","text":"The basic model of consumer choice studies the decision of a single person regarding what goods to acquire, and how much to buy of each of them, taking as given the prices of the goods and the income level of the consumer. Our simple model assumes that each consumer chooses the \u201cbest\u201d combination of goods ---or bundle--- that \u201che can afford\u201d. The idea of \u201cbest\u201d builds on the notions of preferences and utility; our model captures \u201caffordability\u201d via budget sets. Preferences : The preferences on an individual consist of his personal ranking over all possible alternatives. We often capture these preferences by the so called utility function. Budget Set : The budget set of an individual is the collection of all alternatives that he can afford given his resources (income or wealth) and the prices of the goods he faces in the market. Together, (1) and (2) induce choices. That is, they determine what consumption bundles are selected by the consumer. As prices and/or income change, so does the budget set and (often) the combination of goods that the consumer selects. The demand function describes the consumption decisions for all different combinations of prices and income levels. To simplify the exposition, we will focus on a simple version of the consumer problem. The components of our model are as follows: We assume there are only two goods: good 1 and good 2. We represent the quantities of these goods as $x_{1} and x_{2}$ , respectively. The ordered pair ($x_{1},x_{2}$) denotes a bundle of goods. The prices of the goods are represented by p\u2081 and p\u2082, respectively. The income level of the consumer is denoted by m . Example : Suppose good 1 is orange juice and good 2 is salad. Then $x_{1},x_{2}$ is the quantity of salads (say in pounds). In this context, the combination ($\\frac{1}{2}$ , 1) represents the bundle of half liter of orange juice and one pound of salad. Suppose also that a liter of orange juice costs 5 dollars, a pound of salad costs 10 dollars, and the income level of the consumer is 500 dollars. In our notation, this information is concisely written as $p_{1} = 5, p_{2} = 10$ , and m = 500. This simple two-goods model can be easily extended to more goods (e.g., it can be extended to the set of all goods you can get in the supermarket). We use the two-goods case because it helps us to illustrate the main concepts and tools in a simple way, often invoking a graphical representations of the model.","title":"2.1 Rational Choice"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#utility-function","text":"Consumer preferences represent a ranking over consumption bundles or combinations of different goods. For instance, if the consumer strictly prefers bundle $(x_{1}, x_{2}) = (1 pizza, 2 burritos)$ over bundle $(x_{1}',x_{2}') = (2 pizzas, 1 burritos)$ , then the first combination of goods is ranked before than the second one in the preferences of this consumer. We will always assume consumer preferences are transitive. Transitivity means that if a consumer prefers bundle a over bundle b, and he also prefers bundle b over bundle c , then it must be the case that the consumer prefers bundle a over bundle c Transitivity is a very important property as it allows us to talk of the most preferred bundle! When it holds, we can often conveniently represent the preferences of a given consumer by what we call a utility function. To do so, we also require the preferences to be continuous. Roughly speaking, \u201cpreferences are continuous\u201d if whenever an alternative A is preferred to an alternative B, any option A\u2019 that is sufficiently similar to option A is also preferred to option B. Formally, a utility function is a function that assigns a number to each bundle in such a way that these numbers respect the underlying preference ranking of the consumer (i.e., the utility function assigns higher numbers to more preferred combinations of goods). Example : : Let good 1 be pizza and good 2 be burrito. In addition, assume the preferences of a given consumer over slices of pizza and burritos are captured by the next utility function: $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ Suppose that a first bundle contains 16 slices of pizza and 1 burrito, so that u (16,1)=2. If a second bundle has 3 slices of pizzas and 3 burritos, then u (3,3)=3. It follows that this consumer prefers the second over the first combination of goods (i.e., he likes to have 3 slices of pizzas and 3 burritos more than having 16 slices of pizza and 1 burrito.) Though there are many types of utility functions, in this course we will mainly focus on three of them: Cobb-Douglas, Perfect Complements (i.e., Leontieff), and Perfect Substitutes (i.e., linear). We will sometimes also use the CES utility function. (CES stands for constant elasticity of substitution. We will clarify this term later.) The specific mathematical (functional) form of each of these utilities is given in the next table. - To do so, we also require the preferences to be continuous. Roughly speaking, \u201cpreferences are continuous\u201d if whenever an alternative A is preferred to an alternative B, any option A\u2019 that is sufficiently similar to option A is also preferred to option B. Utility Function Mathematical Form Perfect Substitutes $u(x_{1},x_{2})=ax_{1},ax_{2}$ Perfect Complements Cobb-Douglas $u(x_{1},x_{2})={(x_{1}^{a}), (x_{2}}^{b})$ CES $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(a{x_{1}}^{r}+b{x_{2}}^{r})^{1/r}$ In the first three cases we typically assume $a,b\\geq 0$ . In the last one, we let $r\\leq 1$ . As we shall see, these parameters play very different roles in each specification. As we explained earlier, the important aspect of a utility function is that it captures the underlying preferences of a specific consumer. According to the ordinal utility theory, it is meaningful to ask whether a bundle is better than a second one, but not how much better it is. In other words, the actual numbers that a utility function assigns to the specific bundles are not important as far as they preserve (respect) the ranking of the individual over the combination of goods. It follows that when the preferences of an individual can be represented by a utility function, then an infinite number of them can capture the same preferences! Example : Suppose that our previous consumer strictly prefers 16 slices of pizza and 1 burrito to 3 slices of pizzas and 3 burritos. In addition, he is indifferent between having 3 slices of pizzas and 3 burritos and 2 slices of pizzas and 4 burritos. Moreover, he strictly prefers 2 slices of pizzas and 4 burritos to having 2 slices of pizzas and 2 burritos. In summary, this consumer ranks the different combinations of goods as follows: $1^{st} (16,1) ; 2^{nd} (3,3) and (2,4) ; 3^{rd} (2,2)$ It follows that a utility function represents his preferences if and only if it assigns numbers to each combination of goods in the following way: $u(16,1) > u(3,3) = (2,4) > u (2,2)$ Let us now consider the three possible utility functions shown in the next table. Which of these three utilities represent the preferences we just described? Bundle Utility 1 Utility 2 Utility 3 (16,1) 8 12 4 (3,3) 7 9 2 (2,4) 6 9 2 (2,2) 3 2 -1 It is clear that Utility 1 does not do so. The reason is that it assigns to bundle 3,3 a higher number than to bundle 2,4, contradicting the fact that the consumer is indifferent between these two combinations of goods. On the other hand, even when Utility 2 and Utility 3 assign different numbers to the bundles, both of them are consistent with the preference ranking of the consumer. Therefore, Utility 2 and Utility 3 both represent this consumer\u2019s preferences. There are two concepts associated to the utility function, which play a key role in explaining consumer behavior, namely, indifference curves and marginal rate of substitution. We next elaborate on each of them. An indifference curve is the set of all bundles that a consumer regards as equally desirable. In other words, it is the set of all combination of goods that give the consumer the same utility level. We often assume that preferences satisfy a property that says more is always better. Under this monotonicity assumption, the indifference curves cannot be \u201cthick\u201d and they must be downward slopping. Weakly preferred sets also provide a convenient characterization of preferences. In terms of the utility function, a weakly preferred set is the sets of all bundles ($x_{1},x_{2}$) such that u($x_{1},x_{2}$) is at least as large as a specific value k . Example : Let $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$. Then, $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4} = k$ implicitly describes the set of all combinations of goods 1 and 2 that give the consumer a level k of utility. For each k, this set ---which can be also written as $x_{2}=k^{2}/x_{1}$ --- denotes a specific indifferent curve. We can get all the indifference curves by changing k In addition, for each k, the associated weakly preferred set is $x_{2}\\geq k^{4/3}/(x_{1})^{1/3}$ . The next figure shows the typical shape of the indifference curves for the case of Perfect Substitutes (top, left), Perfect Complements (top, right), Cobb-Douglas (bottom, left) and CES (bottom, right). You can find an interactive version of this figure here: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sh2hmdkie9 As we will explain, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is intimately related with the concept of marginal utility (MU). Thus, we start describing the latter. The marginal utility of good 1 captures the extra utility the consumer gets if he slightly increases the consumption of good 1, while keeping fixed the consumption of the second one. We can similarly define the marginal utility of good 2. When the utility function $u(x_{1},x_{2})$ is differentiable, then the marginal utilities of goods 1 and 2 (denoted by MU1 and MU2 ) are simply the partial derivatives of $u(x_{1},x_{2})$ with respect to goods 1 and 2, respectively. That is, $MU_{1}=\\partial u(x_{1},x_{2})/\\partial x_{1}$ and $MU_{2}=\\partial u(x_{1},x_{2})/\\partial x_{2}$ Example : Let [u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}]. Then, $MU_{1}(x_{1},x_{2})=\\frac{1}{4}(x_{1})^{-3/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ and $MU_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})=\\frac{3}{4}(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{-1/4}$ We showed before that two different utility functions might induce the same ranking over consumption bundles. These two utility functions represent the same preferences. As the next example illustrates, an issue with the concept of marginal utility is that it is sensitive to the way in which we represent consumer preferences. Example : Let us work with the same utility as in the previous example, $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$, except that now we multiply it by 4. That is, $u(x_{1},x_{2})=4(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$. Then, $MU_{1}(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{-3/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ and $MU_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})=3(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{-1/4}$ Since this utility is just $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ multiplied by 4, it represents the same ranking over consumption bundles as the utility of the previous example. Nevertheless, the two MUs are four times as large with $u(x_{1},x_{2})=4(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ as compared to $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ . Notice that the assumption of monotonicity implies that MUs are always positive. As we mentioned above, a second concept related to the utility function that is very important in economics is the marginal rate of substitution (MRS). The MRS is a measure of the relative value of good 1 in terms of good 2. In particular, it measures (approximately) of how much the consumer is willing to give up of good 2 in order to obtain an additional unit of good1. Mathematically, the MRS is given by the slope of an indifference curve (IC) at a given bundle. Therefore, it can be obtained as follows: Assuming that preferences are monotonic and can be represented by the utility function $u(x_{1},x_{2})$, we can think of an IC as a function $x_{2}(x_{1})$. Along this IC, we have: $u(x_{1},x_{2}(x_{1})) = k $ If we differentiate this function with respect to x1 (using the Chain Rule ), we get $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_{1}}(x_{1},x_{2})+[\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_{2}}(x_{1},x_{2})]\\frac{\\partial x_{2}}{x{1}}(x_{1}) =0$ Since the MRS is the slope of the IC, we get that $MRS = \\frac{\\partial x_{2}}{\\partial x_{1}}(x_{1}) = - MU_{1}/MU_{2}$ A very important property of the MRS is that (unlike the marginal utilities MUs) it is not affected by the way in which we measure preferences! Example : Let the utility function be either $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ or $u(x_{1},x_{2})=4(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$. In both cases, we have that $MRS(x_{1},x_{2})=-MU_{1}(x_{1},x_{2})/MU_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})=-x_{2}/3x_{1} $ In other words, the MRS remains the same for both utilities. When the utility function increases in the consumption of each good, then the MRS is negative. This means that if the consumer sacrifices a bit of one good, then he must be compensated with a bit more of the other good to be as well as before. In addition, we often assume that the MRS is decreasing (in absolute value). This captures the idea that the consumer prefers some sort of diversification across goods ---he prefers to have some of each good rather than having a lot of one good and nothing of the other. A decreasing MRS means that the more the consumer sacrifices of one good, the more he needs to be compensated with the other one to be as well as before. When this happens, we we say that consumer preferences are convex.","title":"Utility Function"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#budget-set","text":"The budget set is the set of all bundles or combinations of goods that are affordable by the consumer. That is, the set of all ($x_{1},x_{2}$) that satisfy: $p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2}\\leq m$ where $p_{1}, p_{2}$ and m represent the price of good 1, the price of good 2, and the income level, respectively. The set of bundles that exhaust the income of the consumer is called the budget line: $p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2} = m$ In both cases, we also assume $x_{1}\\geq 10$ and $x_{2}\\geq 0$ In a graph where $x_{1}$ is represented along the horizontal axis, and $x_{2}$ along the vertical axis, the slope of the budget line is given by $-p_{1}/p_{2}.$ Notice that the maximum amount of good 1 that the consumer can purchase is given by the intercept of the budget line with the horizontal axis, and its magnitude is $m/p_{1}$. Similarly, for good 2, this magnitude is $m/p_{2}$. The next picture shows the budget set and line for the case of $p_{1}$ = 2, $p_{2}$ = 2 and m = 40. Example : Suppose the government imposes a per unit tax of t dollars on good 2. Then, the new budget line is $p_{1}x_{1}+(p_{2}+t)x_{2}=m.$ Notice that the tax reduces the number of units the consumer can afford of both goods 1 and 2. This happens even while the tax only affects the price of good 2.","title":"Budget Set"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#optimal-choice","text":"We have discussed both consumer\u2019s preferences (captured by his utility function) and consumption restrictions (captured by his budget set). To characterize consumer behavior ---that is, to explain the bundle that he will acquire in the market for each combination of prices and income level--- we assume the consumer behaves in an optimal way. In words, we postulate that the consumer selects the most desirable bundle out of the ones that he can actually afford. Mathematically, this implies that the consumer solves the following problem: $max_{x_{1}, x_{2}}\\left \\{ u(x_{1},x_{2}): p_{1}x_{1}+p_{1}x_{2} = m \\right \\}$ We start with a graphical explanation for the solution of the consumer problem. The next figure shows the case of a consumer with income level m=40 , who faces prices $p_{1}=2$ and $p_{2}=2$. Thus, his budget set is $2x_{1}+2x_{2}\\leq 40$ , which is illustrated in the shaded triangular area. Suppose that the utility function of this consumer has a Cobb-Douglas specification $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{3/4}(x_{2})^{1/4}$. The left panel of the figure also shows four ICs corresponding to the following different utility levels: $k_{1}=6, k_{2}=9, k_{3}=11.39$ and $k_{4}=15$ . As it is readily verified, the further away from the origin, the higher the utility level of the consumer. Recall that we assume the consumer acquires the most desirable combination of goods among the ones that he can afford. This consumer can definitely get a utility level of 6 ---since there are some affordable bundles (under the shaded area) that provide this level of satisfaction. The same applies to a utility of level of 9. Notice that this is not true for a utility of level 15 ---since there is no affordable bundle that provides the consumer this level of satisfaction. It turns out that, in this example, the highest achievable utility level is $k_{3}=5^{1/4}15^{3/4}\\simeq 11.39$ , with the optimal consumption bundle being (5,15). notice that we have chosen to draw only four out of an infinite number of possible indifference curves It follows from our simple example that the best affordable combination of goods is the one that belongs to the highest IC that just touches ---usually in only one point--- the budget constraint. We now present the mathematical solution of the consumer problem for three of the most commonly used utility functions. Optimal Choice with Cobb-Douglas Preferences The consumer problem with Cobb-Douglas preferences is given by $max_{x_{1},x_{2}} \\left \\{ x_{1}^{a} x_{2}^{b} : p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2} = m\\right \\}$ To find the optimal bundle when preferences are Cobb-Douglas (C-D), we use the Lagrangian method. The associated Lagrangian function is $L(x_{1},x_{2},\\lambda )={x_{1}^{a}x_{2}^{b}-\\lambda (p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2}-m)}$ Recall that we can get the solution of our initial problem by finding the maximizers of the Lagrangian function. The first order conditions of our problem (FOCs) are: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_{1}}=ax_{1}^{a-1}x_{2}^{b}-\\lambda p_{1} = 0$ (FOC1) $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_{2}}=bx_{1}^{a}x_{2}^{b-1}-\\lambda p_{2} = 0$ (FOC2) $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda }=-p_{1}x_{1}-p_{2}x_{2}+m = 0$ (FOC3) To find the optimal consumption bundle, we need to find the $x_{1}, x_{2}$, and $\\lambda$ that solve this system of three equations and three unknowns (as a function of $p_{1}, p_{2}$ and m ). We can solve this system of equations by first obtaining an expression for $\\lambda$ from both FOC1 and FOC2, and then make these two terms equal to each other. Doing so we get: $\\frac{ax_{1}^{a-1}x_{2}^{b}}{p_{1}} =\\frac{bx_{2}^{b-1}x_{1}^{a}}{p_{2}}$ This expression simplifies to: $\\frac{ax_{2}}{bx_{1}}= \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ Combining this last result with FOC3, we finally get: $x_{1}* = \\frac{a}{a+b}\\frac{m}{p_{1}}$ | $x_{2}* = \\frac{b}{a+b}\\frac{m}{p_{2}}$ To find $\\lambda$ * , we can simply plug $x_{1}$ * and $x_{2}$ * into either FOC1 or FOC2. It follows from our previous results, that the optimal solution satisfies $MRS = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ and $m = p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2}$ The first condition states that the relative value of the goods from the perspective of the consumer has to equal their relative value from the perspective of the market. The second condition simply states that the optimal bundle must be on the budget line. Example : Let us assume that $u(x_{1},x_{2})=x_{1}^{a} x_{2}^{b}$ with a = \u00bc, b = \u00be, m = 40, $p_{1} = 2$ and $p_{2} = 2$. Thus, the Lagrangian of the problem is: $L (x_{1},x_{2},\\lambda ) = x_{1}^{1/4}x_{2}^{3/4}-\\lambda (2x_{1}+2x_{2}-40)$ Taking the partial derivatives wrt $x_{1} x_{2}$ and $\\lambda$, we get: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_{1}}=(1/4)x_{1}^{1/4-1}x_{2}^{3/4}-\\lambda 2 = 0$ (FOC1) $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_{2}}=(3/4)x_{2}^{3/4-1}x_{1}^{1/4}-\\lambda 2 = 0$ (FOC2) $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda }= 40 - 2x_{1}-2x_{2} = 0$ (FOC3) To find the optimal $x_{1} and x_{2}$, we first get $\\lambda$ from FOC1 and FOC2 and then make these two terms equal to each other: $\\frac{1/4x_{1}^{-3/4}x_{2}^{3/4}}{2} = \\frac{3/4x_{2}^{-1/4}x_{1}^{1/4}}{2}$ This expression simplifies to: $\\frac{x_{2}}{3x_{1}}=\\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ Combining the latter with FOC3, we solve for $x_{1} and x_{2}$ and obtain $x_{1}* =( \\frac{1}{4}) (\\frac{40}{2}) = 5$ and $x_{2}* =( \\frac{3}{4}) (\\frac{40}{2}) = 15$ Optimal Choice with Perfect Substitutes Preferences When the goods are perfect substitutes from the perspective of the consumer, then we cannot use the Lagrangian method to obtain the optimal bundle. The reason is that, in this case, the solution is usually non-interior. We next explain how to approach the consumer problem in this case. The consumer problem with perfect substitute preferences is given by: $max_{x_{1},x_{2}}\\left \\{ ax_{1}+bx_{2}: p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} = m \\right \\}$ In this case, the MRS between the goods is given by: $MRS = \\frac{\\partial u/ \\partial x_{1}}{\\partial u/ \\partial x_{2}} = \\frac{a}{b}$ Recall that the MRS defines the relative value of good 1 in terms of good 2 from the perspective of the consumer. With perfect substitute preferences, the MRS is just a constant. On the other hand, the ratio $\\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ describes the relative market valuation of good 1 in terms of good 2. In the case of perfect substitutes, the optimal choice relies on the comparison between the MRS and the ratio of prices. Case 1: If $MRS = \\frac{a}{b} > \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ then $x_{1}$ * = $\\frac{m}{p_{1}}$ and $x_{2}$ * = 0 Case 2: If $MRS = \\frac{a}{b} < \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ then $x_{1}$ * = 0 and $x_{2}$ * = $\\frac{m}{p_{2}}$ Case 3: If $MRS = \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ then $x_{1}$ * $\\in [0, \\frac{m}{p_{1}}]$ and $x_{2}$ * $\\in [0, \\frac{m}{p_{2}}]$ such that $x_{1}$ * + $x_{2}$ * = m To understand the first case, notice that $\\frac{a}{b} > \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ means that the extra value of the first good as compared to the second one from the perspective of the consumer is higher than the extra cost of getting the first good as compared to getting the second one. Thus, it is convenient for this person to spend all his income in the first good. Case 2 has a similar explanation. Case 3 corresponds to a situation in which the MRS equals the relative prices; in this last case, the consumer is indifferent between spending all, some, or no money in good 1 as far as he spends the rest of his income in the other good Example : Suppose a =1.5 and b =1. Then, MRS =1.5. This means that this consumer is willing to give up to 1.5 units of good 2 for an additional unit of good 1. On the other hand, let us assume that $p_{1}$=2, $p_{2}$=2 and m=40. Thus, the relative market value of good 1 in terms of good 2 is just 1, i.e., $\\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}} = 1$. Given that $MRS = 1.5 > 1 = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ regardless the bundle selected, we are in Case 1 above. Thus, it is optimal for the consumer to spend all his income in good 1. That is, $x_{1}$ * = $\\frac{m}{p_{1}}=\\frac{40}{2} = 20$ and $x_{2}$ * = 0 The next figure illustrates this solution: Optimal Choice with Perfect Complement Preferences Remember that the utility function for perfect complement preferences is given by $u(x_{1}x_{2})=min\\left \\{ \\frac{x_{1}}{a},\\frac{x_{2}}{b} \\right \\}$ As with the case of perfect substitutes, when the goods are perfect complements from the perspective of the consumer, then we cannot use the Lagrangian method to obtain the optimal bundle. In this case, the reason is that the corresponding utility function is not differentiable. The consumer problem with perfect complements utility function is given by $max_{x_{1},x_{2}}\\left \\{ min\\left \\{ \\frac{x_{1}}{a}, \\frac{x_{2}}{b} \\right \\} : p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} = m \\right \\}$ Notice that, in this case, as long as $p_{1}, p_{2}$, a and b are all strictly positive, the optimal bundle will always satisfy: $\\frac{x_{1}}{a} =\\frac{x_{2}}{b}$ The reason is quite simple. Suppose that instead we have $\\frac{x_{2}}{b} > \\frac{x_{1}}{a}$ . Then, $x_{2}/b>x_{1}/a=u(x_{1},x_{2})=min\\left \\{ \\frac{x_{1}}{a}, \\frac{x_{2}}{b} \\right \\}$ It follows that this consumer could be strictly better off by spending a bit less in the second good and using that money to get a bit more of the first good! This process repeats till $x_{1}/a = x_{2}/b$ . (A similar idea applies when $x_{1}/a > x_{2}/b$ .) In addition, we know that the optimal bundle must satisfy the budget constraint. That is, $p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} = m$ Combining our two observations, we get: $p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}\\frac{bx_1}{a} = m$ So that $x_{1}$ * = $\\frac{ma}{(ap_{1}+bp_{2})}$ . In a similar way, we get that $x_{2}$ * = $\\frac{mb}{(ap_{1}+bp_{2})}$ Example: Let us assume $u(x_{1}, x_{2}) = min( \\frac{x_{1}}{a}, \\frac{x_{2}}{b} )$ with a=1, b=1, $p_{1}$=2, $p_{2}$=2, and m=40. In this case, we know that the optimal consumption of good 1 and 2 must satisfy: $x_{1} = x_{2}$ We also know that: $2x_{1} + 2x_{2} = 40$ Using these two equations, we get that: $x_{1}$ * = $\\frac{ma}{(ap_{1}+bp_{2})} = \\frac{40}{2+2} = 10$ and $x_{2} * = \\frac{mb}{(ap_{1}+bp_{2})} = \\frac{40}{2+2} = 10$ The next figure illustrates this solution.

We study choices and welfare implications under two tax specifications that provide the same income level for the government.","title":"Optimal Choice"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#22-demand-function","text":"","title":"2.2 Demand Function"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#individual-demand-function","text":"We explained earlier that the consumer problem consists of selecting the most preferred bundle among the ones that the consumer can afford. Mathematically, the problem was described as follows $max_{x_{1},x_{2}}\\left \\{ u(x_{1},x_{2}) : p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} = m \\right \\}$ The solution of this problem consists of a pair x1 and x2 . We typically write this choice as: $x_{1}$ * = $x_{1}(p_{1},p_{2},m)$ and $x_{2}$ * = $x_{2}(p_{1},p_{2},m)$ to highlight the fact that the optimal amounts of good 1 and good 2 depend on the prices of the goods and the income level of the consumer. In other words, optimal choices are function of $p_{1}, p_{2}$ and m . We refer to them as the individual demand functions. The demand function of good i (with i =1,2) receives different names according to the way in which it responds to changes in each of its arguments. (In economics, we often call this exercise comparative statics.) We next describe the main relationships. Changes with respect to income: If $x_{i}(p_{1}\u2022p_{2},m)$ increases with m, we say the good is normal. If $x_{i}(p_{1}\u2022p_{2},m)$ decreases with m, we say the good is inferior. Changes with respect to own price: If $x_{i}(p_{1}\u2022p_{2},m)$ decreases with $p_{i}$, we say the good is ordinary. If $x_{i}(p_{1}\u2022p_{2},m)$ increases with $p_{i}$, we say the good is Giffen. Changes with respect to the price of the other good: If $x_{i}(p_{1}\u2022p_{2},m)$ increases with $p_{j}$, we say the goods are substitute. If $x_{i}(p_{1}\u2022p_{2},m)$ decreases with $p_{j}$, we say the goods are complement. Out of all these possibilities, Giffen goods are probably the less frequently observed. Jensen and Miller (AER, 2008) provided the first real-world evidence of Giffen behavior, i.e., a good with upward-sloping demand. The authors found this behavior when studying rice subsidies for poor households in Hunan and Gansu, China. Example : Let the utility be $u(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{3/4}$ . We showed before that, in this case, $x_{1}$ * = $x_{1}(p_{1}p_{2},m)=\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{m}{p_{1}}$ and $x_{2}$ * = $x_{2}(p_{1}p_{2},m)=\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{m}{p_{2}}$ Thus, according to our previous definitions, both goods are normal and ordinary. Since the quantity demanded of one of them does not depend on the price of the other one, we also say that they are independent. The next figures provide a graphical representation of the our comparative statics results. Own price changes: Income Changes: Our previous classifications of the goods seem to suggest that about any change in consumption is possible as prices and income levels change. Thus, one immediately wonders: Does our theory generate any testable implication? We will show that the answer is yes. This is important as, otherwise, our theory of consumer choice could never be proven false! The testable implication of our theory receives the name of Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences (WARP) . This basic result is quite simple. If a bundle is acquired, then it must be the case that the consumer prefers this combination of goods to all other affordable ones. In other words, via choices, the consumer is providing us some information regarding his preferences. By testing WARP we make sure that consumer\u2019s choices don\u2019t provide contradicting information. The next example illustrates this possibility. Example : Imagine that we observe the next choices Price of good 1 Price of good 2 Income Choice of good 1 Choice of good 2 $p_{1} = 2$ $p_{2} = 1$ m = 10 $x_{1}$ * = 4 $x_{2}$ * = 2 p1 = 1 p2 = 1 m = 8 $x_{1}$ * = 1 $x_{2}$ * = 7 We are interested in the next question: Could these choices have been made by a utility maximizer? The answer is no. The reason is as follows. When the prices and income level were given by $p_{1}=2, p_{2}=1$, and m=10, the consumer selected 4 units of good 1 and 2 units of good 2. Notice that, since 2 x 1 + 1 x 7 < 10, he could have selected to consume 1 unit of good 1 and 7 units of good 2. This is telling us that this consumer strictly prefers bundle (4, 2) to bundle (1, 7). Alternatively, when the prices and income level of the consumer were given by $p_{1}=1, p_{2}=1$, and m=8, he selected 1 unit of good 1 and 7 units of good 2. Notice that, since 1 x 4 + 1 x 2 < 8, he could have selected to consume 4 units of good 1 and 2 units of good 2. Thus, this consumer strictly prefers bundle (1, 7) to bundle (4, 2) which contradicts our previous claim. The WARP simply formalizes our observations in the last example. Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference (WARP) : Suppose that $(x_{1},x_{2})$ is selected when the prices are $(p_{1},p_{2})$, and $(x_{1}',x_{2}')$ is chosen when the prices are $(p{1}',p{2}')$. If $p_{1}x_{1}' + p_{2}x_{2}' \\leq p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2}$, then it must be that $p_{1}'x_{1} + p_{2}'x_{2} > p_{1}'x_{1}'+p_{2}'x_{2}'.$ In words, WARP is telling us that if $(x_{1},x_{2})$ was selected when $(x_{1}',x_{2}')$ was affordable, then it cannot be the case that $(x_{1},x_{2})$ was affordable when the consumer selected $(x_{1}',x_{2}').$ The next figure displays the three key cases to check whether WARP is satisfied or not. Using our previous definition, it is easy to see that the only violation happens in panel (a). Redo Note 1 without assuming any particular functional form for the utility function. Echenique et. al (2010) uses US data for purchasing decisions in the supermarket to check whether people behave according to our model. While they find some violations, they prove that they are not that severe. They also relate the strength of the violations with people characteristics. Among other results, they find that older people behave closer to the model.","title":"Individual Demand Function"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#market-demand-function","text":"We just learned that the individual demand function of good i , with i =1,2, represents the choice of good i in the bundle that maximizes the utility of the consumer for each pair of prices and income level. If we refer to an arbitrary consumer as consumer j, then $x_{1}^{j} (p_{1}, p_{2}, m^{j})$ and $x_{2}^{j} (p_{1}, p_{2}, m^{j})$ indicate consumer j 's demands for goods 1 and 2, respectively. The market demands for these goods are given by $Q_{1}^{d}(p_{1}, p_{2}, m^{1}, m_{2}, ...., m^{J}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J}x_{1}^{j}(p_{1}, p_{2}, m^{j})$ $Q_{2}^{d}(p_{1}, p_{2}, m^{1}, m_{2}, ...., m^{J}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J}x_{2}^{j}(p_{1}, p_{2}, m^{j})$ where J indicates the number of consumers in the economy. That is, for each fixed vector of prices and income levels, the market demand of each good is simply the sum of the individual market demands of all consumers in the economy for that specific good. Notice that the market demand of each good depends on the prices of the two goods as well as the income distribution. We just derived the quantity demanded for each good as a function of the market prices. It is sometimes convenient to express market prices as functions of quantities. We refer to P(x) as the inverse demand function of a certain good. Example : Suppose that the economy consists of two individuals with demand functions given by $x^{1}(p, m^{1}) = 20 - p$ and $x^{2} (p,m^{2}) = 30-3p$ The aggregate demand function is thereby given by $Q^{d}(p, m^{1}, m^{2}) = x^{1}(p,m^{1})+x^{2}(p,m^{1}) = 50 - 4p$ if $p\\leq 10$ $Q^{d}(p, m^{1}, m^{2}) = x^{1}(p,m^{1})+x^{2}(p,m^{1}) = 20 - p$ if $p > 10$ Note that we add quantities for the same price! The next picture illustrates this result. When demands are linear, then there is usually a kink in the market demand. In this example, the inverse demand function is given by $p(Q, m^{1}, m^{2}) = 12.5 - \\frac{1}{4}Q$ if $Q \\geq 10$ $p(Q, m^{1}, m^{2}) = 20- Q$ if $Q < 10$ Let $Q^{d}(p)$ be the demand function. The elasticity of demand is given by $\\varepsilon = (\\partial Q^{d}(p)/\\partial p)(p/Q^{d}(p))$ Since, generally, $\\partial Q^{d} (p)/\\partial p \\leq 0$ , we often express $\\varepsilon $ in absolute values. The elasticity of demand measures how sensitive is the demand function to price changes. When $|\\varepsilon |$>1, we say the demand is elastic. This means that the quantity demanded is very responsive to price changes. It usually happens when the good we are considering has close substitutes. For example, A4 paper from Office World and A4 paper from Boise. When $|\\varepsilon |$<1, we say the demand is inelastic. This means that the quantity demanded does not respond very much to changes in prices. It usually happens when the good does not have close substitutes. For example, some medications, like Triluma. Example: Let $Q^{d}(p) = a-bp$ . The elasticity of demand is $|\\varepsilon| = bp/(a-bp)$ The next picture shows the way in which $|\\varepsilon |$ varies with x. Notice that the good is elastic or inelastic according to the amount that the consumer gets.","title":"Market Demand Function"},{"location":"S2_ConsumerChoice/#23-intertemporal-choice","text":"The model we studied in the last section assumes that either there is a single period of time or that the consumer spends all his income every period, without saving or borrowing. This section shows that a similar approach can be used to model consumer behavior across different periods of time. This extension will allow us to understand the relationship between saving (or borrowing) and the interest rate. It is also important as it shows that, with small modifications, our initial model can accommodate many situations of interest. In our simple intertemporal choice model, consumers decide how to allocate their income between consumption today and tomorrow. The main components of the model are as follows. Two goods: current consumption $(c_{1})$ and future consumption $(c_{2})$ Prices of current and future consumption is 1 (i.e., we assume no inflation) Income levels: current income $(m_{1})$ and future income $(m_{1})$ Interest rate: r As you can see, we make a few simplifying assumptions. First, we assume that there is no inflation. Second, we assume there is a bank that allows the consumer to either save his current income $(m_{1})$ or to borrow up from his future income $(m_{2})$. Moreover, we suppose that the interest rate r is the same for saving and borrowing money. (These restrictions can be easily relaxed with small, though probably tedious, modifications of our main results.) In the intertemporal model, consumers\u2019 preferences are captured by a utility function over current and future consumption $u(c_{1},c_{2})$ Because we are allowing the consumer to either save or borrow money, the consumer faces a single budget constraint for the \u201cwhole life\u201d ---or two periods. Expressed in future value, the lifetime income of this person is 1+rm1+m2. To understand better this equation, notice that 1+r represents the extra income the consumer can experience in the second period per dollar that he saves in the first period of time. If in period of time 1 the consumer puts 1 dollar of his income in the bank, then in the second period the bank gives the consumer the dollar he invested plus the interest rate r. Similarly, her lifetime consumption is 1+rc1+c2. His budget constraint simply reflects that these two amounts must be the same. That is, $(1+r)c_{1} + c_{2} = (1+r)m_{1} + m_{2}$ Notice that, in a graph where $c_{1}$ is in the horizontal axis and $c_{2}$ is in the vertical axis, the slope of the budget line is -(1+r). We can also write the budget line in present value terms $c_{1}+c_{2}/(1+r) = m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+r)$ In this representation, 1/(1+r) indicates how much more the consumer can buy in period of time 1 if he sacrifices 1 unit of consumption in period 2. To achieve this goal, the consumer borrows 1/(1+r) dollars from the bank in the first period of time with the promise of paying [1/(1+r)] x (1+r) =1 to the bank in period of time 2. The (intertemporal) problem of the consumer is as follows: $max_{c{1},c{2}}\\left \\{ u(c_{1},c_{2}) : (1+r) c_{1}+c_{2}=(1+r)m_{1}+m_{2}\\right \\}$ Notice that, from a mathematical perspective, this problem is very similar to our initial consumer choice model! Moreover, it is indeed identical if we let $x_{1}=c_{1}$ and $x_{2}=c_{2}$ $p_{1}=1+r$ and $p_{2}=1$ $m = (1+r)m_{1}+m_{2}$ Example: As we just described, we assume no inflation and indicate by $m_{1}, m_{2}$, and r the corresponding income levels and interest rate. In this example, we will also suppose the consumer has the following utility specification for consumption in periods 1 and 2 $u(c_{1},c_{2}) = (c_{1})^{1/4}(c_{2})^{3/4}$ The problem of the consumer is $max_{c{1},c{2}}\\left \\{ (c_{1})^{1/4}(c_{2})^{3/4} : (1+r) c_{1} + c_{2} = (1+r) m_{1} + m_{2}\\right \\}$ Given the connection we just established between this model and the initial consumer problem, we can use our previous results to state that $c_{1}$ * = $\\frac{1}{4} [(1+r)m_{1}+m_{2}][1/(1+r)]$ and $c_{2}$ *= $\\frac{3}{4} [(1+r)m_{1}+m_{2}]$ **Note 2: Revealed Preferences and the Interest Rate.(( In this note we study the effect of increasing the interest rate for a \"saver\" and a \"borrower\" consumer. We just studied the optimal allocation of consumption levels between today and tomorrow. Let us next assume that our intertemporal consumer faces the possibility of investing some amount of money today with the promise of receiving some specific return tomorrow. Should the consumer make such an investment? We now develop a criterion which the consumer should use in deciding whether or not to do so. To be more clear, let us consider an investment which has a negative cash flow of - dollar A today ---the investment--- and a positive cashflow of dollar B in 1 year ---the return. The question we want to address is Should the person invest in this project? The answer to this question is indeed very simple. The person should invest if (and only if) $-A + B/(1+r) \\geq 0$ (Positive Net Present Value in Finance.) The reason is that if $-A + B/(1+r) \\geq 0$ , then the budget line of the consumer shifts up. Notice that the previous rule does not depend on the preferences of the consumer!

We face risks in almost every single decision we make since, in most cases, it is hard to anticipate the exact consequences of each alternative. Let\u2019s start with an example. As an economics professor at UC Berkeley, Gary Becker had to give an exam at 8:00 AM. He arrived at the university at 7:55 AM, so he did not have enough time to go to the parking lot and be on time for the test. He faced two options: go to the parking lot, so to avoid the parking ticket, but be late for the exam with certainty; or park in front of the Economics Department, so to be be on time for the exam, but face the risk of getting a parking ticket. As you can see, each option has pros and cons. The question is how to compare them! To do so we need a model that would allow us to compare options in which we are not sure about the final outcomes. We next present the most commonly used method. In economics, we typically use the framework of Expected Utility (EU). In this approach, every possible outcome has a utility level associated to it. In this example, u(late, no penalty) would denote the utility that Gary Becker gets from option (1). Under option (2), there are two possibilities, he either gets caught or he doesn't. Let u(on time, penalty) and u(on time, no penalty) indicate the utility levels under these two possible outcomes of option (2). Also, suppose that he estimates that if he parks in front of the Economics Department, then the probability of getting caught is p . According to the expected utility approach, Gary Becker values the risky alternative as a weighted combination of the utilities he could experience in that course of action. Following that logic he should decide to be late if and only if: u(late, no penalty)>p u(on time, penalty)+(1-p)u(on time,no penalty) Otherwise, he should choose to \u201cbreak the law\u201d, and park in front of the Econ Department. This example is given by Gary Becker as the starting point of his economic analysis of criminal decisions. More generally, the expected utility model assumes that the utility a person gets from each risky choice depends on (i) the utility of the different outcomes the individual might face; and (ii) the probability of each of these possible outcomes. In particular, the valuation of a risky choice in the expected utility model is as follows: $EU=p_{1}u(c_{1})+p_{2}u(c_{2})$ where $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are two possible outcomes usually measured in monetary terms (for example $1 and $10), and $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are their corresponding probabilities (for example \u2153 and \u2154, respectively). Under this specification, the overall utility is just the weighted average of the utility that the person gets under each possible circumstance, where the weights are the probabilities that the person assigns to the different events. As we mentioned earlier, though the expected utility approach is probably the most widely utilized method, it is not the only model that has been used to study choice under risk. The field of behavioral economics studies other conceptual approaches, among which the prospect theory by Tversky and Kahneman (1979) is probably the most prominent one. In what follows, we will only consider situations where the different outcomes of the risky choice are simply different amounts of money. In that sense, we will restrict attention to situations that are similar to the ones that consumers face when they buy lottery tickets or go to the casino. Example : (Lottery) An individual has 100 dollars in his wallet and is evaluating whether to buy a lottery ticket. The ticket costs 20 dollars and he knows that with 50% chance he can get 40 dollars, and with 50% chance he gets 0 dollars. In our notation, $c_{1}=100-20+40=120$, $c_{2}=100-20=80$, $p_{1}=0.5$ and $p_{2}=0.5$. Let us also assume, the utility function of this person is given by: $u(c_{i})=c_{i}^{1/2}$ where c_{i} is the money that the consumer gets in each outcome i . Under this specification, if the person buys the ticket, his expected utility (denoted by EU ) is given by: Expected Utility of the Lottery Ticket (EU) = $\\frac{1}{2}u(100-20+40) + \\frac{1}{2}u(100-20)$ = $\\frac{1}{2}(120)^{1/2}+ \\frac{1}{2}(80)^{1/2}$ $\\approx$ 9.95 On the other hand, if the individual does not get the ticket, his utility is $u(100)=(100)^{1/2}=10$, with certainty. Since 10 > 9.95, this consumer will rather prefer not to buy the ticket for the lottery. \u25a0 It is important to notice that the expected value of buying the ticket in the previous example is $\\frac{1}{2} (100-20+40) + \\frac{1}{2}(100-20) = 100$ That is, it the same as not buying the ticket. Yet, this consumer preferred to avoid taking the risk involved in the lottery. The next example shows the key role that the shape of the utility function has in determining whether a person takes or not a specific risk. Example : (Investment) An individual is contemplating the possibility of either investing his money in a risky project that pays 36 dollars if he wins and 0 dollars otherwise or in a safe project that always pays 18 dollars. He estimates that the probability of winning in the risky project is \u00bd. That is, $c_{1}=36, c_{2}=0, p_{1}=0.5$ and $p_{2}=0.5.$ We are interested in a simple question: Should a rational person invest in the risky project? We next show that the answer of this question depends on the preferences of the individual, which are captured by the shape of the utility function u. If the person gets involved in the risky project, then his expected utility is EU[ risky project ]=$\\frac{1}{2}u(36)+\\frac{1}{2}u(0)$ Since the safe option always pays $18, he should invest in the risky project whenever EU[ risky project ]=$\\frac{1}{2}u(36)+\\frac{1}{2}u(0)\\geq u(18)$ Otherwise, this person would be better off putting his money in the safe option. Without any other information regarding the shape of u , we cannot answer our initial question. We next contemplate three different possibilities. Let us assume first that $u(c_{i})=(c_{i})^{1/2}$. In this case, the expected utility of the risky project is EU[ risky project ]=$\\frac{1}{2}u(36)+\\frac{1}{2}u(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(36)^{1/2}+\\frac{1}{2}(0)^{1/2} = 3$ In addition, the utility he gets from the safe project is $(18)^{1/2} \\approx 4.24$. Since EU[ risky project ]= $\\frac{1}{2}(36)^{1/2}+\\frac{1}{2}(0)^{1/2} = 3 < 4.24$ we conclude that this person should select the safe option. The following picture illustrates this first situation. Note: You can access an interactive version of this graph here . Let us now suppose that $u(c_{i}=c){i}$. In this case, we have that EU[ risky project ]= $\\frac{1}{2}u(36)+\\frac{1}{2}u(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(36)+ \\frac{1}{2}(0)$ In addition, the utility from the safe project is (18)=18. Thus, this person is just indifferent between the safe and the risky option. Finally, let us set $u(c_{i}=(c_{i})^{2}$. In this case, we have that EU[ risky project ]= $ \\frac{1}{2}u(36)+ \\frac{1}{2}u(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(36)^{2}+ \\frac{1}{2}(0)^{2}=648$ In addition, the utility from the safe project is u(18)=(18)^{2}=324. Thus, this person clearly prefers the risky investment. We often classify individuals according to their attitudes toward risk. As we shall see, the standard classification is intimately related to our last example. It involves the comparison between the expected utility of the risky project $p_{1}u(c_{1})+p_{2}u(c_{2})$ and the utility of the person evaluated at the expected value of the risky project $u(p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2})$ The expected value of the risky project ---$p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2}$---- can be thought as the amount of money that a person who invests in the risky project many times would get on average. The next table classifies people according to attitudes toward risk and establishes a connection between these attitudes and the curvature of the utility function. Attitude/Behavior Shape of utility function Property of utility function Risk Averse Concave Utility $p_{1}u(c_{1})+p_{2}u(c_{2})\\leq u(p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2})$ Risk Neutral Linear Utility $p_{1}u(c_{1})+p_{2}u(c_{2})= u(p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2})$ Risk Loving Convex Utility $p_{1}u(c_{1})+p_{2}u(c_{2})> u(p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2})$ Example : Suppose that, as in the last example, an individual is contemplating the possibility of either investing his money in a risky project that pays 36 dollars if he wins and 0 dollars otherwise or in a safe project that always pays 18 dollars. The probability of winning in the risky project is again 1/2. In the previous example we studied the investment decision of three individuals that differed regarding the shape of the utility function: We found that the first individual would not invest, the second one was indifferent, and the third one would always invest in the risky project. Given our last table, we could have made the prediction without any calculation! The reason is that the expected value of the risky project was given by $\\frac{1}{2}36+\\frac{1}{2}0=18$ This is the same as the money the individual makes with the safe investment. In addition, $u(c_{i})=(c_{i})^{1/2}$ is a concave function, $u(c_{i})=c_{i}$ is a linear function, and $u(c_{i})=(c_{i})^{2}$ is a convex function.","title":"2.4 Choice Under Risk"},{"location":"S3_Producer/","text":"Producer (Chapter 3) Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A) Natalia Lazzati UCSC - Winter 2019 3.1 Profit Maximization We will study profit maximization in competitive markets. These are markets where each firm takes as given both the price of the good that it produces and the prices of the inputs that it uses to produce that good (e.g., labor and capital). There are two key concepts in our model of the competitive firm: Technology : It tells us how much the firm can produce for each combination of inputs. Prices of the output ---or the good that it produces--- and inputs. Together, 1 and 2 determine both how much a competitive firm will optimally produce and how is going to produce it. To simplify the exposition, we will focus on a simple version of the problem of the firm ---as we did with consumer problem. The components of our model are as follows: We assume there are only two inputs: input 1 and input 2. We represent the quantities of these inputs as $x_{1} and x_{2}$, respectively. The production function is given by $f(x_{1},x_{2})$. The prices of the inputs are represented by w\u2081 and w\u2082, respectively. The price of the output is represented p . The purpose of the firm is to select the combination of inputs that maximizes its profits. More formally, we can express its problem as follows $max_{x_1,x_2}\\left \\{ pf(x_{1},{x_2})-w_{1}x_{1}-w_{2}x_{2} \\right \\}$ where $pf(x_{1},x_{2})$ is the revenue of the firm and $w_{1}x_{1} + w_{2}x_{2}$ To solve this problem, we will assume that the production function of the firm, $f(x_{1},x_{2})$, is differentiable and the solution of the problem is interior. When these conditions are satisfied, then the First Order Conditions (FOCs) are as follows $p\\partial f(x_{1},x_{2})/\\partial x_{1}-w_{1} = 0$ (FOC1) $p\\partial f(x_{1},x_{2})/\\partial x_{2}-w_{2} = 0$ (FOC2) The solution of this problem is given by the pair $x_{1}(p,w_{1},w_{2})$ and $x_{2}(p,w_{1},w_{2})$ that simultaneously solves the system of two equations FOC1 and FOC2. These functions are called the unconditional input demands of the firm. The output function is given by $y(p,w_{1},w_{2})=f(x_{1}(p,w_{1},w_{2}),x_{2}(p,w_{1},w_{2})).$ This function tells us how much the firm will optimally produce for each combination of the prices of the output and inputs that it might face. The optimal solution of the firm problem has an interesting economic interpretation. To show it, let $MP_{i}(x_{1},x_{2})=\\partial f(x_{1},x_{2})/\\partial x_{i}$ for i=1,2 be defined as the marginal product of input i. It represents the extra amount of the good that the firm gets by increasing input i in one unit. Using this concept, the optimal solution satisfies $MP_{i}(x_{1},x_{2})/w_{1}=MP_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})/w_{2}$ That is, the marginal product per dollar spent in each input is the same for the two of them. To see why this should be the case, let us assume that the firm is producing at a point in which $MP_{i}(x_{1},x_{2})/w_{i}>MP_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})/w_{2}$ This means that the extra product per dollar spent in input 1 is strictly higher than the extra product the firm gets per dollar spent in input 2. In this case, the firm could be better off by increasing the amount of the first input and decreasing the amount of the second one. Doing so, the firm could produce the same in a cheaper way! This process stops when both terms are the same. (A similar idea applies to the case in which $MP_{i}(x_{1},x_{2})/w_{i}<MP_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})/w_{2})$ Example : Let us assume the production function of the firm has a Cobb-Douglas specification. In particular, let $f(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{1/4}$ Under this specification, the problem of the firm is $max_{x_{1}, x_{2}} \\left \\{ px_{1}^{1/4}x_{2}^{1/4} -w_{1}x_{1}-w_{2}x_{2}\\right \\}$ Differentiating with respect to the two input variables we get $p(1/4)x_{1}^{-3/4}x_{2}^{1/4}-w_{1} = 0$ (FOC1) $p(1/4)x_{1}^{1/4}x_{2}^{-3/4}-w_{2} = 0$ (FOC2) Together, these two equations imply that $ x_{2}w_{2} = x_{1}w_{1}$ Substituting this expression in FOC1 we get $x_{1}$* =$(1/16) p_{2} w_{1}^{-3/2}w_{2}^{1/2}$ and $x_{2}$* =$(1/16) p_{2} w_{1}^{1/2}w_{2}^{-3/2}.$ Thus, the optimal level of production of the firm is y*= $f(x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*})=[(1/16)p^{2}w_{1}^{-3/2}w_{2}^{1/2}]^{1/4}[(1/16)p^{2}w_{1}^{1/2}w_{2}^{-3/2}]^{1/4}=p/[4(w_{1}w_{2})^{1/2}]$ When we studied the problem of the consumer we illustrated the ideas by using three different specifications of the utility function: Cobb-Douglas Perfect Substitutes Perfect Complements While the same three specifications can be used for the production function of the firm, some of them lead to unreasonable conclusions for the competitive environment. Example : Let us assume the production function of the firm has a perfect substitutes specification. In particular, let $f(x_{1},x_{2})=x_{1} + x_{2}$ Under this specification, the problem of the firm is $max_{x_{1},x_{2}} \\left \\{ p(x_{1}+x_{2}) - w_{1}x_{1}-w_{2}x_{2} \\right \\}$ Suppose that, for some $x_{1}=x_{1}' and x_{2}=x_{2}'$, $p(x_{1}'+x_{2}')-w_{1}x_{1}'-w_{2}x_{2}'=10>0$ That is, with this combination of inputs the firm is making 10$. Let us next consider using twice as much input as before. Then, $p(2x_{1}'+2x_{2}')-w_{1}(2x_{1}')-w_{2}(2x_{2}') = 2[p(x_{1}'+x_{2}')-w_{1}x_{1}'-w_{2}x_{2}'] = 20 > 0$ This means that, by doubling the amount of the inputs, then the firm gets twice as much profits as before. By repeating this process a few times, you will realize that the optimal level of inputs are just infinite! Since we do not observe firms behaving in this way, we conclude that this specification of the production function is probably not adequately when we model competitive markets. One can show that a similar problem appears for the perfect complement specification of the production function and with the Cobb-Douglas one when $a + b > 1$ 3.2 Profit Maximization and Cost Minimization The problem of the firm can be studied in a different way $max_{y} \\left \\{py - C(y) \\right \\}$ where $C(y)$ is the minimum cost of producing y. The FOC of this problem is captured by $p=C'(y)$ where $C'(y) = \\partial C(y)/\\partial y$ is the marginal cost function. The solution of this problem, $y*=y(p)$, is the supply function (or supply curve) of the firm. To show that this problem is indeed equivalent to the one of maximizing profits we just studied, we need to find an expression for the minimum cost function C(y). The problem of cost minimization can be postulated as follows: The firm wants to produce a specific amount of good, y, in the cheapest possible way. Formally, its problem is given by $min_{x_{1}x_{2}}\\left \\{ {w_{1}x_{1}+w_{2}x_{2} : f(x_{1},x_{2})=y} \\right \\}$ Note that this problem is relevant for any profit maximizing firm ---even those with market power! The problem of cost minimization is a constrained optimization problem. Thus, assuming f is differentiable, and the solution is interior, we can use the Lagrangian method to solve it. The Lagrangian for this minimization problem is given by $L(x_{1},x_{2},\\lambda)= w_{1}x_{1} + w_{2}x_{2} -\\lambda[f(x_{1},x_{2})-y]$ Differentiating this function with respect to the two input variables and \u03bb we get $w_{1}-\\lambda\\partial f(x_{1},x_{2})/ \\partial x_{1} =0$ (FOC1) $w_{2}-\\lambda\\partial f(x_{1},x_{2})/ \\partial x_{2} =0$ (FOC2) $[f(x_{1},x_{2}-y] =0$ (FOC3) The solution of this problem is given by a pair $x_{1}'=x_{1}(w_{1},w_{2},y)$ and $x_{2}'=x_{2}(w_{1},w_{2},y)$ These functions are called the conditional input demands of the firm. The reason for the name is that we are conditioning them to get a specific level of output. The (minimum) cost function is obtained as follows $C(y)=w_{1}x_{1}(w_{1},w_{2},y) + w_{2}x_{2}(w_{1},w_{2},y)$ Example : Let us assume the production function of the firm has the Cobb-Douglas specification $f(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{1/4}$ Under this specification, the problem of the cost minimizing firm is $min_{x_{1},x_{2}} \\left \\{ w_{1}x_{1}+w_{2}x_{2}:x_{1}^{1/4} x_{2}^{1/4}=y \\right \\}$ The Lagrangian function for this problem is given by $L(x_{1},x_{2},\\lambda )=w_{1}x_{1}+w_{2}x_{2}- \\lambda (x_{1}^{1/4}x_{2}^{1/4}-y)$ Differentiating this function with respect to the two input variables and $\\lambda$ we get $w_{1}-\\lambda(1/4)x_{1}^{-3/4}x_{2}^{1/4} =0$ (FOC1) $w_{2}-\\lambda(1/4)x_{1}^{1/4}x_{2}^{-3/4} =0$ (FOC2) $- x_{1}^{1/4}x_{2}^{1/4} +y =0$ (FOC3) Using FOC1 and FOC2, we get $x_{1}=x_{2}w_{2}/w_{1}$ Substituting the latter in FOC3, we get $-(x_{2}w_{2}/w_{1})x_{2}^{1/4} +y =0$ Thus, $x_{2}' =y_{2}(w_{1}/w_{2})^{1/2}$ . Proceeding in a similar way, we get $x_{1}' =y_{2}(w_{2}/w_{1})^{1/2}$ It follows that the cost function of the firm is given by $C(y)=w_{1} y^{2}(w_{2}/w_{1})^{1/2} + w_{2} y^{2} (w_{1}/w_{2})^{1/2} = 2y^{2}(w_{1}w_{2})^{1/2}$ Given this result, the problem of the profit maximizing firm can be expressed as follows $max_y\\left \\{ py-2y^{2}(w_{1}w_{2})^{1/2} \\right \\}$ Differentiating the objective function with respect to y, we get $p-4y(w_{1}w_{2})^{1/2} = 0$ Thus, the optimal level of production is $y'=p/[4(w_{1}w_{2})^{1/2}]$ This is exactly the same expression we obtained in the previous section. 3.3 Supply Function We have seen that the supply function of the firm is a function that indicates the amount of the good that the firm produces ---to maximize profits--- for each pair of prices of the good and inputs. We are often interested in the relation between the level of production and the market price of the good. In these cases, we assume that the prices of the inputs remain the same and express the supply of the firm as a sole function of the price of the good y*=y(p) The supply function of the market combines the supply curve of each firm. It state the aggregate level of production that the firms would optimally choose for each possible price of the good under consideration. In the time horizon where the number of firms is fixed (typically called the \u201cshort run\u201d), the market supply curve is the horizontal sum of each firm supply curve: $Q^{s}(p)=\\sum_{h=1}^{h=H}y^h(p)$ where $y^{h}(p)=y^{h*} is the supply function of firm j , and H is the total number of firms currently in the market. Example: In the previous example, the supply curve of a firm with Cobb Douglas technology $f(x_{1},x_{2})=x_{1}^{1/4}x_{2}^{1/4}$ was $y*=p/[4(w_{1}w_{2}^{1/2}]$. Let us assume that the prices of the production factors are both equal to one; that is, $w_{1}=w_{2}=1$. This implies that $y^{h}(p)=p/4$. If there are 100 identical firms in the market, then the supply curve of the market is $Q^{s}(p)=\\sum_{h=1}^{h=100}y^h(p) = \\sum_{h=1}^{h=100} \\frac{p}{4} = 100\\frac{p}{4} = 25p$ That is, the market supply is $Q^{s} = 25p$. 3.4 Stay in the Market? We can define the profit function of the firm as the amount of money that the firm makes for each combination of prices of the good and inputs, assuming that the firm selects the combination of inputs that maximizes its profits. That is, $\\pi (p,w_{1},w_{2})=max_{x_{1},x_{2}}\\left \\{ pf(x_{1},x_{2})-w_{1}x_{1}-w_{2}x_{2} \\right \\} = max_{y}\\left \\{ py-C(y) \\right \\}$ This function represents the maximum profits the firm can make in the market. A competitive firm decides to stay in the market if and only if $ \\pi (p,w_{1},w_{2}) \\geq 0$ This is the same as to say $p\\geq C(y^{*})/y^{*}$ where C(y)/y represents the average cost function of the firm. There are two important concepts in economics that the firm should consider while taking the stay/exit decision. These ideas are also important in many daily decisions we make. The first concept is the opportunity cost . It captures the loss of potential gain from other courses of action when one specific alternative is chosen. When the firm decides whether to stay in the market, it should consider the opportunity cost of all inputs! For instance, it should take into account the value of the working time of the owner of the firm. The second concept is the sunk cost . It captures a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. When the firm decides whether to stay in the market, it should not consider the sunk costs! For instance, its decision should not be affected by the cost of evaluating the feasibility of an investment project. In the long run, we might expect $p=C(y^{*})/y^{*}$ The reason is that, whenever p>C(y )/y , many firms find it attractive to enter the market. The entrance of new firms usually increases the overall level of production, pushing the price down. This process repeats till the initial condition p = C(y^ )/y is reached.","title":"Producer (Chapter 3)"},{"location":"S3_Producer/#producer-chapter-3","text":"","title":"Producer (Chapter 3)"},{"location":"S3_Producer/#intermediate-microeconomics-econ-100a","text":"","title":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A)"},{"location":"S3_Producer/#natalia-lazzati","text":"","title":"Natalia Lazzati"},{"location":"S3_Producer/#ucsc-winter-2019","text":"","title":"UCSC - Winter 2019"},{"location":"S3_Producer/#31-profit-maximization","text":"We will study profit maximization in competitive markets.

The optimal solution of the firm problem has an interesting economic interpretation. To show it, let $MP_{i}(x_{1},x_{2})=\\partial f(x_{1},x_{2})/\\partial x_{i}$ for i=1,2 be defined as the marginal product of input i. It represents the extra amount of the good that the firm gets by increasing input i in one unit. Using this concept, the optimal solution satisfies $MP_{i}(x_{1},x_{2})/w_{1}=MP_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})/w_{2}$ That is, the marginal product per dollar spent in each input is the same for the two of them. To see why this should be the case, let us assume that the firm is producing at a point in which $MP_{i}(x_{1},x_{2})/w_{i}>MP_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})/w_{2}$ This means that the extra product per dollar spent in input 1 is strictly higher than the extra product the firm gets per dollar spent in input 2. In this case, the firm could be better off by increasing the amount of the first input and decreasing the amount of the second one. Doing so, the firm could produce the same in a cheaper way! This process stops when both terms are the same. (A similar idea applies to the case in which $MP_{i}(x_{1},x_{2})/w_{i}<MP_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})/w_{2})$ Example : Let us assume the production function of the firm has a Cobb-Douglas specification. In particular, let $f(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1})^{1/4}(x_{2})^{1/4}$ Under this specification, the problem of the firm is $max_{x_{1}, x_{2}} \\left \\{ px_{1}^{1/4}x_{2}^{1/4} -w_{1}x_{1}-w_{2}x_{2}\\right \\}$ Differentiating with respect to the two input variables we get $p(1/4)x_{1}^{-3/4}x_{2}^{1/4}-w_{1} = 0$ (FOC1) $p(1/4)x_{1}^{1/4}x_{2}^{-3/4}-w_{2} = 0$ (FOC2) Together, these two equations imply that $ x_{2}w_{2} = x_{1}w_{1}$ Substituting this expression in FOC1 we get $x_{1}$* =$(1/16) p_{2} w_{1}^{-3/2}w_{2}^{1/2}$ and $x_{2}$* =$(1/16) p_{2} w_{1}^{1/2}w_{2}^{-3/2}.$ Thus, the optimal level of production of the firm is y*= $f(x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*})=[(1/16)p^{2}w_{1}^{-3/2}w_{2}^{1/2}]^{1/4}[(1/16)p^{2}w_{1}^{1/2}w_{2}^{-3/2}]^{1/4}=p/[4(w_{1}w_{2})^{1/2}]$ When we studied the problem of the consumer we illustrated the ideas by using three different specifications of the utility function: Cobb-Douglas Perfect Substitutes Perfect Complements While the same three specifications can be used for the production function of the firm, some of them lead to unreasonable conclusions for the competitive environment. Example : Let us assume the production function of the firm has a perfect substitutes specification. In particular, let $f(x_{1},x_{2})=x_{1} + x_{2}$ Under this specification, the problem of the firm is $max_{x_{1},x_{2}} \\left \\{ p(x_{1}+x_{2}) - w_{1}x_{1}-w_{2}x_{2} \\right \\}$ Suppose that, for some $x_{1}=x_{1}' and x_{2}=x_{2}'$, $p(x_{1}'+x_{2}')-w_{1}x_{1}'-w_{2}x_{2}'=10>0$ That is, with this combination of inputs the firm is making 10$. Let us next consider using twice as much input as before. Then, $p(2x_{1}'+2x_{2}')-w_{1}(2x_{1}')-w_{2}(2x_{2}') = 2[p(x_{1}'+x_{2}')-w_{1}x_{1}'-w_{2}x_{2}'] = 20 > 0$ This means that, by doubling the amount of the inputs, then the firm gets twice as much profits as before. By repeating this process a few times, you will realize that the optimal level of inputs are just infinite! Since we do not observe firms behaving in this way, we conclude that this specification of the production function is probably not adequately when we model competitive markets. One can show that a similar problem appears for the perfect complement specification of the production function and with the Cobb-Douglas one when $a + b > 1$","title":"3.1 Profit Maximization"},{"location":"S3_Producer/#32-profit-maximization-and-cost-minimization","text":"The problem of the firm can be studied in a different way $max_{y} \\left \\{py - C(y) \\right \\}$ where $C(y)$ is the minimum cost of producing y. The FOC of this problem is captured by $p=C'(y)$ where $C'(y) = \\partial C(y)/\\partial y$ is the marginal cost function. The solution of this problem, $y*=y(p)$, is the supply function (or supply curve) of the firm. To show that this problem is indeed equivalent to the one of maximizing profits we just studied, we need to find an expression for the minimum cost function C(y). The problem of cost minimization can be postulated as follows: The firm wants to produce a specific amount of good, y, in the cheapest possible way. Formally, its problem is given by $min_{x_{1}x_{2}}\\left \\{ {w_{1}x_{1}+w_{2}x_{2} : f(x_{1},x_{2})=y} \\right \\}$ Note that this problem is relevant for any profit maximizing firm ---even those with market power! The problem of cost minimization is a constrained optimization problem. Thus, assuming f is differentiable, and the solution is interior, we can use the Lagrangian method to solve it.

The reason for the name is that we are conditioning them to get a specific level of output.

There are two important concepts in economics that the firm should consider while taking the stay/exit decision. These ideas are also important in many daily decisions we make. The first concept is the opportunity cost . It captures the loss of potential gain from other courses of action when one specific alternative is chosen. When the firm decides whether to stay in the market, it should consider the opportunity cost of all inputs! For instance, it should take into account the value of the working time of the owner of the firm. The second concept is the sunk cost . It captures a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. When the firm decides whether to stay in the market, it should not consider the sunk costs! For instance, its decision should not be affected by the cost of evaluating the feasibility of an investment project. In the long run, we might expect $p=C(y^{*})/y^{*}$ The reason is that, whenever p>C(y )/y , many firms find it attractive to enter the market.

When we say market structure, we often refer to the number of firms in the market; the ease with which firms can enter and leave the market; and the ability of firms to differentiate their products from those of their rivals. One of the main market structures we study in economics is the so called \u201ccompetitive market\u201d. In a competitive market, a single agent (either a firm or a consumer) cannot alter the market price with its sole actions. As a consequence, each of them takes prices as given and select how much to buy or produce. Notice that the consumers and the firms we have studied so far behave in exactly this fashion. this structure is often referred to as a perfectly competitive market Competitive markets typically exhibit the next characteristics: the products of the firms are almost identical from the perspective of the consumers; the consumers can easily get information about the prices of all ---or most--- sellers; there are many producers, so each of them represents a tiny fraction of the market; there are many consumers, so each of them represents a tiny fraction of the market; it is easy for each firm to enter and leave the market; and there is a relatively equal access to technology and inputs by the potential participants of the industry. Some commodity markets (e.g. the soybeans market) operate close to perfect competition. A competitive equilibrium indicates a market price at which the amount that the firms would like to produce equals the amount of the good that the consumers would like to buy. We can study this question in the short or in the long run. In the short run, we assume that the number of firms is fixed. In this case, the competitive equilibrium is given by the price level p* for which the total quantity that consumers are willing to demand (Qd) is the same as the total quantity that firms decide to supply (Qs). That is, Example : Suppose that there are 100 identical consumers with demand functions for a specific good given by In addition, let us assume that there are 12 identical firms, each of which has a supply function given by Adding up the demand of each consumer, we get that the market demand is given by Adding up the supply of each firm, we get that the market supply is given by Thus, the short run competitive equilibrium price solves Thus, In the long run, we assume that firms have enough time to make entry/exit decisions. We say there is free entry and exit if there are no barriers to enter or exit the industry. As we explained earlier, if there is free entry, then, in the long run, the firms make zero profits. More precisely, the long run equilibrium consists of a price level (p ), a market quantity (Q ) and a number of firms (H*) that simultaneously satisfy the next two conditions: Quantity demanded equals quantity supplied: Profits are zero for every incumbent firm: for all . Notice that the zero profit condition in the long run equilibrium contemplates the fact that the number of firms is determined within the model, by the characteristics of the industry. Example : Consider an industry where all firms are identical and exhibit a cost function given by: Moreover, assume that the demand function is given by . The long-run competitive equilibrium can be obtained as follows. First notice that each firm will optimally select how much to produce solving the next problem The FOC of this problem is captured by In addition, we know that, in the long-run, each of them makes zero profits. Thus, Combining these two results, we get y'=50. Thus, the equilibrium price is p'=15. To determine how many firms will enter the market, notice that, if p'=15, then the quantity demanded is given by Since, and each firm produces , we get that . In sum, we have that We often read in the newspapers about different policies that the government of the US implements to make specific markets more competitive. A natural question arises: Why are competitive markets desirable? To answer this question, we need to introduce the concepts of consumer and producer surplus. Consumer surplus is defined as the difference between consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for a good and the price that they have to actually pay to buy each of the units that they decide to acquire. Graphically, it is the area below the demand curve and above the market price. Producer surplus, on the other hand, is the difference between the price that the firms get for selling the good and the cost of producing each unit they put on the market. Graphically, it is the area above the supply curve and below the price that producers are charging for the good. The total surplus of the market is just the sum of consumer and producer surplus. Competitive markets are desirable as they maximize to Note: see an interactive version of this graph here . Example : Suppose the demand curve is given by and the supply curve is . If we calculate the equilibrium price p and the equilibrium quantity Q we get If we draw the demand and supply curves and identify the surpluses graphically, we will see that those are triangles. Using the fact that the area of a triangle is base times height divided by two, then the consumer surplus (CS) is given by: Similarly, the producer surplus (PS) is given by: 4.2 Monopoly We study an industry in which there is only one firm, a monopoly. We are interested in situations where this firm has power to set the market price. In this sense we are ruling out what we call contestable markets; these are markets where there is only one firm but if this firm increases the market price, then other firms will surely enter. There are a few factors that can lead to monopolies: Essential facility: Controlling a scarce resource that any rival firm would need. For example, owning the only quarry in a region generates a cost advantage in the production of gravel. Superior technology: That is, a better way of organizing production. For example, Henry Ford's assembly lines and standardization. Patents: These are licenses that protect a firm from imitation of technologies or informational secrets. For example, many pharmaceutical companies. Network Externalities: Consumers benefit from using the same product as everyone else. Gives incumbent firm advantage. For example, Facebook and Ebay History of fighting entry via price wars or costly advertising campaigns. The problem of the monopoly is as follows. We can let the firm choose the market price (p), and consumers decide how much they want to consume. Or we can model output (y) as its variable of choice. (But not both!) In the latter case, the maximization problem is given by where is the minimum cost of producing y. The FOC for the monopoly problem is where is the marginal revenue, is the marginal cost, There is an alternative formulation of the FOC, which helps us to \u201cquantify\u201d the power of the firm to set a \u201chigh\u201d market price. First, notice that the MR can be rewritten in an alternative way where is the price elasticity of demand. Then, the FOC takes the form of where is called the mark-up. This representation of the firm\u2019s optimal choice, makes it clear that the monopoly sets the price above its marginal cost. The mark-up measures how much above it is! For this reason, the latter has being used by regulating authorities as a measure of market power. A priori, the mark-up can either be calculated from price and measures of cost, or from estimates of the elasticity of demand. In practice, a starting point for this calculation can come from the income statement of a firm where you learn profit margins from COGS. (Drawbacks: This is a measure of AC ---average costs--- not MC ---marginal costs---, and may not include all the opportunity costs of the firm.) Example : Suppose that the monopolist faces a linear demand curve Its cost is also linear C(y)=cy(with a>c). Thus, the problem of the firm is given by The FOC is It follows that In addition, its mark-up is Deadweight Loss of Monopoly In general, the monopoly produces less output than firms in a competitive market. Moreover, for some of the extra units that competitive markets would produce people are willing to pay more than the cost of producing them. Thus, a natural question arises: Why doesn't the monopoly increase production? The reason is that to convince people to buy these extra units, the firm needs to lower the market price not only to the new consumers, but also to all of them! The deadweight loss (DL) is the difference in Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS) between a competitive market and the monopoly. Example : As before, suppose that the monopolist faces a linear demand curve Its cost is also linear The efficient level of production requires . Doing so, we get We obtained earlier that the monopolist optimally produces and selects a market price In this application, the DL is given by Price Discrimination In the previous section we assumed the monopolist charged all the consumers the same market price for the good. There are many situations where this assumption does not hold. That is, situations where this firm sets different prices to different consumers. In this section, we study three different types of price discrimination: First-degree price discrimination: Prices differ from person to person. Second-degree price discrimination: Prices depend on quantities. Third-degree price discrimination: Prices differ across people but depend on observable characteristics (e.g., age or students vs non-students). First-Degree Price Discrimination This is the simplest type of price discrimination. In this case, the monopolist selects a difference price for each consumer. Ideally, this price captures the maximum willingness to pay of the consumer! An example of this type of behavior is probably given by the car dealers. We showed before that the regular monopolist produces less than the optimal output level ---i.e., the one that maximizes social welfare. The reason is that, when it produces more units of the good, it has to lower the price of all previous units in order to sell the extra output. Thus, What if we allow the monopoly to charge different prices to different consumers? If we do so, then the monopolist would produce an efficient level of outcome! There are, however, at least two problems with this type of price discrimination: From the perspective of the monopoly, it is hard to implement due to lack of information. From the perspective of the society, consumer surplus is zero. Second-Degree Price Discrimination This is a non-linear pricing scheme in which the market price depends on the amount of the good that the consumer gets, e.g., discounts by quantity. The monopolist offers different packages ---that differ in number of units and market price--- and each consumer \"self-selects\" into the most attractive one. The purpose of the monopoly is to design the menus so that people self-select into the package that is more convenient for the firm. Third-Degree Price Discrimination Suppose that the monopoly can identify two groups of people with individual demands p1(y1) and p2(y2). These groups depend on observable characteristics, e.g., students vs non-students. The profit maximization problem is Thus, the FOC\u2019s for the monopolist are given by The solution of the problem can be re-written as follows Thus, the price of the monopolist is larger for the group with the lower elasticity of demand! The reason is that this group is less sensitive to price changes. 4.3 Oligopoly By oligopoly we mean an industry with a few firms that behave strategically. To simplify the exposition, we will mainly consider an industry with only two firms (i.e., a duopoly). We will study three types of competition: Cournot: Firms compete by choosing quantities. Stackelberg: One firm is the leader and the other one is the follower. Bertrand: Firms compete by choosing prices. Duopoly of Cournot The model is as follows: There are two firms in the market that compete in quantities. Each firm selects how much to produce in order to maximize profits, taking as given the decision of the other firm. Firms face a linear demand Firms have the same linear cost of production Given this information, the profits of these firms are given by Then, the FOC\u2019s of both firms are From the FOC\u2019s we derive the reaction function of each firm These functions indicate how much a firm would like to produce if it expects certain production level from the other firm. The equilibrium is given by the pair of quantities y1 ,y2 that solve This pair requires both, that each firm behaves optimally given what it expects the other firm will do, and that their predictions be correct. In this application, we get Given this result, the profits of the firms are given by This is an example of what we call Nash equilibrium! Let us next assume that these firms make an initial agreement to maximize joint profits (i.e., they form a cartel). In this case, they behave as if they were only one (a monopoly)! We obtained before that, with linear demand and cost functions, the solution of the monopoly is If both firms in the cartel produce the same amount of output, then . It follows that their profits are given by Thus, the agreement is convenient for the two firms. The reason is that both of them make more money in the cartel than if they were engaged in Cournot competition. Stackelberg In the stackelberg competition there is a leader and a follower. The model is as follows: Two firms in the market, firm 1 is the leader and firm 2 is the follower. Firm 1 (often larger than firm 2) chooses first how much to produce. Firm 2 observes the decision of firm 1, and then selects how much to produce. The demand and cost functions are as before. To solve this problem we study first the decision of the follower, and then the one of the leader. (From a mathematical perspective, this technique is called back induction.) The follower observes the production level of the leader. Then, its profit function is The FOC for the problem of the follower is given by Thus, . The leader knows that the follower selects its production according to Then, its profit function is given by The FOC for the leader is given by It follows that the equilibrium level of production of the leader is The equilibrium level of production of the follower is Given these production levels, the profits of the leader are given by In addition, the profits of the follower are Thus, the leader makes more money than the follower! Duopoly of Bertrand The model is as follows: There are two firms in the market ---producing an identical good--- that compete in prices. Each firm selects its market price in order to maximize its own profits, taking as given the price of the other firm. Firms have the same linear cost of production The equilibrium of this model is very simple Notice that this equilibrium is the same as the competitive one! Whenever one of the firms selects a price above c, then the other firm has incentives to choose a price just below the one by the initial firm. The reason is that the good produced by the two firms is identical and thus, by doing so, the second firm can get the whole market. This process repeats till the above condition is reached. Competition is tougher when firms compete in prices than when they choose quantities!","title":"Markets (Chapter 4)"},{"location":"S4_Markets/#markets-chapter-4","text":"","title":"Markets (Chapter 4)"},{"location":"S4_Markets/#intermediate-microeconomics-econ-100a","text":"","title":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A)"},{"location":"S4_Markets/#natalia-lazzati","text":"","title":"Natalia Lazzati"},{"location":"S4_Markets/#ucsc-winter-2019","text":"","title":"UCSC - Winter 2019"},{"location":"S4_Markets/#41-competitive-equilibrium","text":"The behavior of each firm in the market depends on the structure of the market.

Thus, a natural question arises: Why doesn't the monopoly increase production? The reason is that to convince people to buy these extra units, the firm needs to lower the market price not only to the new consumers, but also to all of them! The deadweight loss (DL) is the difference in Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS) between a competitive market and the monopoly.

In this case, the monopolist selects a difference price for each consumer. Ideally, this price captures the maximum willingness to pay of the consumer! An example of this type of behavior is probably given by the car dealers. We showed before that the regular monopolist produces less than the optimal output level ---i.e., the one that maximizes social welfare. The reason is that, when it produces more units of the good, it has to lower the price of all previous units in order to sell the extra output. Thus, What if we allow the monopoly to charge different prices to different consumers? If we do so, then the monopolist would produce an efficient level of outcome! There are, however, at least two problems with this type of price discrimination: From the perspective of the monopoly, it is hard to implement due to lack of information.

The reason is that their profits depend on the market price and none of the other firms can unilaterally affect it ---they are too small to do so. In this type of environment, there is no no room for strategic thinking. However, there are many other economic contexts, in which strategic thinking plays a fundamental role. As an example, recall our oligopoly analysis. In this section we will study situations in which the payoff of each agent depends on the actions of others. We refer to these situations as games. Moreover, we will focus on static games. In a static game, players act simultaneously and only once. We assume that each player knows how everyone\u2019s actions translate into payoffs, but cannot observe the choices of others. We next present different examples of games and discuss their main features. Prisoner's Dilemma / Social Dilemma Imagine the following situation. Adam likes to watch a tv show online but dislikes online advertisement; so, he is contemplating the possibility of installing an ad blocker in his browser. Suppose he knows that there are only two people in the country that like this show. The other person (let\u2019s call her Bob) is probably considering the same decision. But this is where it gets interesting. The website is funded by ads. Thus, if both players block ads the website cannot operate. Let\u2019s say, A and B in such situation get a utility of 0. If, instead, only A installs an ad blocker, then he gets a utility of 2 and the one without the blocker gets to watch a lot of adverts and gets a utility of -1. If only B installs the adblocker, B gets 2 and A gets -1. If none of them installs the ad blocker, so they both get to watch the show and need to bear some ads, they both receive a utility of 1. All this information can be summarized in the so called bi-matrix. Player B Player A Install Ad Blocker 0,0 2, -1 NOT Install Ad Blocker -1,2 1,1 The question we are interested in is: -- What will Adam and Bob do? -- To answer this question, we start by asking what should player A do if he believes B will take a specific action. Suppose A thinks B is installing the Ad Blocker. In that case, he gets a payoff of zero by installing the ad blocker or a payoff of -1 by not installing the ad blocker. Thus, he should also install the ad blocker. Similarly, if A believes that B will not install the ab blocker, then he gets a payoff of 2 by installing the ad blocker or a payoff of 1 by not installing it. Again, B is better off installing the ad blocker. Since for A it is always better to install the ad blocker regardless of what Bob will do, we say that \u201cinstalling\u201d is a dominant strategy for him. Repeating the exercise for B, we find that \u201cinstalling\u201d is also a dominant strategy for this person. The logical conclusion is therefore that they will both follow their dominant strategies and install the ad blocker. Doing so, they will each end up with a payoff of 2. Because in this case both players are choosing their dominant strategies, we call this type of outcome an equilibrium in dominant strategies. An interesting observation is that ---in this example--- they could both end up better off by cooperating and choosing not to install the ad blocker. However, by following their dominant strategy then end up a lower payoff situation. We call this type of situation a \u201csocial dilemma\u201d or a \u201cprisoner\u2019s dilemma game.\" Coordination Game / Battle of the Sexes Another standard model in game theory is the so called coordination game. In this situation, the incentives of the players are aligned but there are multiple possible outcomes to coordinate on. The classic example of this type of game is the \u201cbattle of the sexes.\" In the battle of the sexes, each member of a married couple has to decide where to go during the weekend. There are two options, each of them can either go to see boxing or ballet. While both prefer to coordinate in one of these options, their preferences regarding the best option differ. The wife prefers going to see ballet together (payoff of 2) over boxing together (payoff of 1), which in turn is preferred to either option by herself (payoff of 0.) The husband prefers going to see boxing together (payoff of 2) over ballet together (payoff of 1), which in turn is preferred to either option by himself (payoff of 0). As you can see, the interdependence in this situation is quite clear: If one of the partners goes to specific place, then the other one prefers to go to that place too. In this situation, it is hard to predict what the couple will do. In particular, there two likely outcomes or equilibria. The first equilibrium is going together to see ballet; this outcome is an equilibrium because when each member of the couple thinks the other one will do so, it is in his/her interest to go to the ballet. Using a similar argument, we can show that going to see boxing is also an equilibrium. The following table illustrate this situation. Player B (husband) Player A (wife) Ballet 2,1 0,0 Boxing 0,0 1,2 The important takeaways from this example are: 1) strategic interdependence implies that my best strategy might change with what I think \u201cthe other\u201d will do; 2) there can be more than one equilibrium; and 3) not all games have dominant strategies. The equilibria for this game is not one in dominant strategies. Instead, each equilibrium (ballet, ballet) and (boxing, boing) is simply an equilibrium in best responses. This type of equilibrium is known as Nash Equilibrium and is due to the famous mathematician John Nash . Mixed Strategies In the previous two games, there was at least one equilibrium in which each player implemented a strategy with certainty. For example, when we say that (ballet, ballet) is an equilibrium we mean that wife chooses ballet for sure and husband chooses ballet for sure as well. We refer to this type of equilibrium as pure-strategy equilibrium. Unfortunately, many games do not have an equilibrium in pure-strategies. In these cases, we often use mixed strategy equilibria as our solution concept. Let\u2019s illustrate the concept of mixed strategy equilibrium with one example. Imagine a penalty kick situation, where player A is the kicker and player B is the goal keeper. To make things simple, let us assume that the kicker has to decide whether to kick left or right. As a consequence, the goalkeeper has to choose whether to fly right or to fly left. Also, let us assume that if the kick goes to the same side that the keeper jumps to, then there is no score and payoffs are 0 for the kicker and 1 for the keeper. If, on the other hand, the kick and the keeper jump to different sides, we assume there is a score and payoffs are 1 for the kicker and 0 for the keeper. The following table illustrates this game. Player B (goal keeper) Left Right Player A (kicker) Left 0,1 1,0 Right 1,0 0,1 Because the kicker wants to choose a different side than keeper, and the keeper wants to choose the same side as kicker, there is no equilibrium in pure strategies. To see this more clearly, imagine, for example, that the kicker believes the goalkeeper is going to the left. In this case, he will want to kick to the right. But if the keeper believes the kick is coming to the right, the keeper will will want to deviate and fly to the right, instead. However, we can find here an equilibrium in mixed strategies. It consists on In our example, the kicker will randomly select left or right with 50% chance each, so the kicker cannot guess what he will do. Conversely, the goalkeeper will fly to the right or the left with 50% chance each.","title":"Game Theory (Chapter 5)"},{"location":"S5_GameTheory/#game-theory-chapter-5","text":"","title":"Game Theory (Chapter 5)"},{"location":"S5_GameTheory/#intermediate-microeconomics-econ-100a","text":"","title":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A)"},{"location":"S5_GameTheory/#natalia-lazzati","text":"","title":"Natalia Lazzati"},{"location":"S5_GameTheory/#ucsc-winter-2019","text":"","title":"UCSC - Winter 2019"},{"location":"S5_GameTheory/#game-theory","text":"In competitive markets firms have no incentives to think about what a specific competitor is doing.

These libraries are loaded as dependencies in the order they appear, for example: Reveal.initialize({ dependencies: [ // Cross-browser shim that fully implements classList - https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js/ { src: 'lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } }, // Interpret Markdown in <section> elements { src: 'plugin/markdown/marked.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: 'plugin/markdown/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, // Syntax highlight for <code> elements { src: 'plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } }, // Zoom in and out with Alt+click { src: 'plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js', async: true }, // Speaker notes { src: 'plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true }, // Remote control your reveal.js presentation using a touch device { src: 'plugin/remotes/remotes.js', async: true }, // MathJax { src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true } ] }); You can add your own extensions using the same syntax. The following properties are available for each dependency object: - src : Path to the script to load - async : [optional] Flags if the script should load after reveal.js has started, defaults to false - callback : [optional] Function to execute when the script has loaded - condition : [optional] Function which must return true for the script to be loaded Ready Event A 'ready' event is fired when reveal.js has loaded all non-async dependencies and is ready to start navigating. To check if reveal.js is already 'ready' you can call Reveal.isReady() . Reveal.addEventListener( 'ready', function( event ) { // event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv } ); Presentation Size All presentations have a normal size, that is the resolution at which they are authored. The framework will automatically scale presentations uniformly based on this size to ensure that everything fits on any given display or viewport. See below for a list of configuration options related to sizing, including default values: Reveal.initialize({ ... // The \"normal\" size of the presentation, aspect ratio will be preserved // when the presentation is scaled to fit different resolutions. Can be // specified using percentage units. width: 960, height: 700, // Factor of the display size that should remain empty around the content margin: 0.1, // Bounds for smallest/largest possible scale to apply to content minScale: 0.2, maxScale: 1.5 }); Auto-sliding Presentations can be configure to progress through slides automatically, without any user input. To enable this you will need to tell the framework how many milliseconds it should wait between slides: // Slide every five seconds Reveal.configure({ autoSlide: 5000 }); When this is turned on a control element will appear that enables users to pause and resume auto-sliding. Alternatively, sliding can be paused or resumed by pressing \u00bba\u00ab on the keyboard. Sliding is paused automatically as soon as the user starts navigating. You can disable these controls by specifying autoSlideStoppable: false in your reveal.js config. You can also override the slide duration for individual slides and fragments by using the data-autoslide attribute: <section data-autoslide=\"2000\"> <p>After 2 seconds the first fragment will be shown.</p> <p class=\"fragment\" data-autoslide=\"10000\">After 10 seconds the next fragment will be shown.</p> <p class=\"fragment\">Now, the fragment is displayed for 2 seconds before the next slide is shown.</p> </section> Whenever the auto-slide mode is resumed or paused the autoslideresumed and autoslidepaused events are fired. Keyboard Bindings If you're unhappy with any of the default keyboard bindings you can override them using the keyboard config option: Reveal.configure({ keyboard: { 13: 'next', // go to the next slide when the ENTER key is pressed 27: function() {}, // do something custom when ESC is pressed 32: null // don't do anything when SPACE is pressed (i.e. disable a reveal.js default binding) } }); Lazy Loading When working on presentation with a lot of media or iframe content it's important to load lazily. Lazy loading means that reveal.js will only load content for the few slides nearest to the current slide. The number of slides that are preloaded is determined by the viewDistance configuration option. To enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your \"src\" attributes to \"data-src\" as shown below. This is supported for image, video, audio and iframe elements. <section> <img data-src=\"image.png\"> <iframe data-src=\"http://slides.com\"></iframe> <video> <source data-src=\"video.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" /> <source data-src=\"video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> </video> </section> API The Reveal object exposes a JavaScript API for controlling navigation and reading state: // Navigation Reveal.slide( indexh, indexv, indexf ); Reveal.left(); Reveal.right(); Reveal.up(); Reveal.down(); Reveal.prev(); Reveal.next(); Reveal.prevFragment(); Reveal.nextFragment(); // Toggle presentation states, optionally pass true/false to force on/off Reveal.toggleOverview(); Reveal.togglePause(); Reveal.toggleAutoSlide(); // Change a config value at runtime Reveal.configure({ controls: true }); // Returns the present configuration options Reveal.getConfig(); // Fetch the current scale of the presentation Reveal.getScale(); // Retrieves the previous and current slide elements Reveal.getPreviousSlide(); Reveal.getCurrentSlide(); Reveal.getIndices(); // { h: 0, v: 0 } } Reveal.getProgress(); // 0-1 Reveal.getTotalSlides(); // State checks Reveal.isFirstSlide(); Reveal.isLastSlide(); Reveal.isOverview(); Reveal.isPaused(); Reveal.isAutoSliding(); Slide Changed Event An 'slidechanged' event is fired each time the slide is changed (regardless of state). The event object holds the index values of the current slide as well as a reference to the previous and current slide HTML nodes. Some libraries, like MathJax (see #226 ), get confused by the transforms and display states of slides. Often times, this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback. Reveal.addEventListener( 'slidechanged', function( event ) { // event.previousSlide, event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv } ); Presentation State The presentation's current state can be fetched by using the getState method. A state object contains all of the information required to put the presentation back as it was when getState was first called. Sort of like a snapshot. It's a simple object that can easily be stringified and persisted or sent over the wire. Reveal.slide( 1 ); // we're on slide 1 var state = Reveal.getState(); Reveal.slide( 3 ); // we're on slide 3 Reveal.setState( state ); // we're back on slide 1 Slide States If you set data-state=\"somestate\" on a slide <section> , \"somestate\" will be applied as a class on the document element when that slide is opened. This allows you to apply broad style changes to the page based on the active slide. Furthermore you can also listen to these changes in state via JavaScript: Reveal.addEventListener( 'somestate', function() { // TODO: Sprinkle magic }, false ); Slide Backgrounds Slides are contained within a limited portion of the screen by default to allow them to fit any display and scale uniformly. You can apply full page backgrounds outside of the slide area by adding a data-background attribute to your <section> elements. Four different types of backgrounds are supported: color, image, video and iframe. Below are a few examples. <section data-background=\"#ff0000\"> <h2>All CSS color formats are supported, like rgba() or hsl().</h2> </section> <section data-background=\"http://example.com/image.png\"> <h2>This slide will have a full-size background image.</h2> </section> <section data-background=\"http://example.com/image.png\" data-background-size=\"100px\" data-background-repeat=\"repeat\"> <h2>This background image will be sized to 100px and repeated.</h2> </section> <section data-background-video=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.mp4,https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.webm\"> <h2>Video. Multiple sources can be defined using a comma separated list.</h2> </section> <section data-background-iframe=\"https://slides.com\"> <h2>Embeds a web page as a background. Note that the page won't be interactive.</h2> </section> Backgrounds transition using a fade animation by default. This can be changed to a linear sliding transition by passing backgroundTransition: 'slide' to the Reveal.initialize() call. Alternatively you can set data-background-transition on any section with a background to override that specific transition. Parallax Background If you want to use a parallax scrolling background, set the two following config properties when initializing reveal.js (the third one is optional). Reveal.initialize({ // Parallax background image parallaxBackgroundImage: '', // e.g. \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg\" // Parallax background size parallaxBackgroundSize: '', // CSS syntax, e.g. \"2100px 900px\" - currently only pixels are supported (don't use % or auto) // This slide transition gives best results: transition: 'slide' }); Make sure that the background size is much bigger than screen size to allow for some scrolling. View example . Slide Transitions The global presentation transition is set using the transition config value. You can override the global transition for a specific slide by using the data-transition attribute: <section data-transition=\"zoom\"> <h2>This slide will override the presentation transition and zoom!</h2> </section> <section data-transition-speed=\"fast\"> <h2>Choose from three transition speeds: default, fast or slow!</h2> </section> Note that this does not work with the page and cube transitions. Internal links It's easy to link between slides. The first example below targets the index of another slide whereas the second targets a slide with an ID attribute ( <section id=\"some-slide\"> ): <a href=\"#/2/2\">Link</a> <a href=\"#/some-slide\">Link</a> You can also add relative navigation links, similar to the built in reveal.js controls, by appending one of the following classes on any element. Note that each element is automatically given an enabled class when it's a valid navigation route based on the current slide. <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-left\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-right\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-up\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-down\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-prev\"> <!-- Previous vertical or horizontal slide --> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-next\"> <!-- Next vertical or horizontal slide --> Fragments Fragments are used to highlight individual elements on a slide. Every element with the class fragment will be stepped through before moving on to the next slide. Here's an example: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/fragments The default fragment style is to start out invisible and fade in. This style can be changed by appending a different class to the fragment: <section> <p class=\"fragment grow\">grow</p> <p class=\"fragment shrink\">shrink</p> <p class=\"fragment roll-in\">roll-in</p> <p class=\"fragment fade-out\">fade-out</p> <p class=\"fragment current-visible\">visible only once</p> <p class=\"fragment highlight-current-blue\">blue only once</p> <p class=\"fragment highlight-red\">highlight-red</p> <p class=\"fragment highlight-green\">highlight-green</p> <p class=\"fragment highlight-blue\">highlight-blue</p> </section> Multiple fragments can be applied to the same element sequentially by wrapping it, this will fade in the text on the first step and fade it back out on the second. <section> <span class=\"fragment fade-in\"> <span class=\"fragment fade-out\">I'll fade in, then out</span> </span> </section> The display order of fragments can be controlled using the data-fragment-index attribute. <section> <p class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"3\">Appears last</p> <p class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\">Appears first</p> <p class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"2\">Appears second</p> </section> Fragment events When a slide fragment is either shown or hidden reveal.js will dispatch an event. Some libraries, like MathJax (see #505), get confused by the initially hidden fragment elements. Often times this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback. Reveal.addEventListener( 'fragmentshown', function( event ) { // event.fragment = the fragment DOM element } ); Reveal.addEventListener( 'fragmenthidden', function( event ) { // event.fragment = the fragment DOM element } ); Code syntax highlighting By default, Reveal is configured with highlight.js for code syntax highlighting. Below is an example with clojure code that will be syntax highlighted. When the data-trim attribute is present surrounding whitespace is automatically removed. <section> <pre><code data-trim> (def lazy-fib (concat [0 1] ((fn rfib [a b] (lazy-cons (+ a b) (rfib b (+ a b)))) 0 1))) </code></pre> </section> Slide number If you would like to display the page number of the current slide you can do so using the slideNumber configuration value. Reveal.configure({ slideNumber: true }); Overview mode Press \"Esc\" or \"o\" keys to toggle the overview mode on and off. While you're in this mode, you can still navigate between slides, as if you were at 1,000 feet above your presentation. The overview mode comes with a few API hooks: Reveal.addEventListener( 'overviewshown', function( event ) { /* ... */ } ); Reveal.addEventListener( 'overviewhidden', function( event ) { /* ... */ } ); // Toggle the overview mode programmatically Reveal.toggleOverview(); Fullscreen mode Just press \u00bbF\u00ab on your keyboard to show your presentation in fullscreen mode. Press the \u00bbESC\u00ab key to exit fullscreen mode. Embedded media Embedded HTML5 <video> / <audio> and YouTube iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a slide. This can be disabled by decorating your element with a data-ignore attribute. Add data-autoplay to your media element if you want it to automatically start playing when the slide is shown: <video data-autoplay src=\"http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4\"></video> Additionally the framework automatically pushes two post messages to all iframes, slide:start when the slide containing the iframe is made visible and slide:stop when it is hidden. Stretching elements Sometimes it's desirable to have an element, like an image or video, stretch to consume as much space as possible within a given slide. This can be done by adding the .stretch class to an element as seen below: <section> <h2>This video will use up the remaining space on the slide</h2> <video class=\"stretch\" src=\"http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4\"></video> </section> Limitations: - Only direct descendants of a slide section can be stretched - Only one descendant per slide section can be stretched postMessage API The framework has a built-in postMessage API that can be used when communicating with a presentation inside of another window. Here's an example showing how you'd make a reveal.js instance in the given window proceed to slide 2: <window>.postMessage( JSON.stringify({ method: 'slide', args: [ 2 ] }), '*' ); When reveal.js runs inside of an iframe it can optionally bubble all of its events to the parent. Bubbled events are stringified JSON with three fields: namespace, eventName and state. Here's how you subscribe to them from the parent window: window.addEventListener( 'message', function( event ) { var data = JSON.parse( event.data ); if( data.namespace === 'reveal' && data.eventName ='slidechanged' ) { // Slide changed, see data.state for slide number } } ); This cross-window messaging can be toggled on or off using configuration flags. Reveal.initialize({ ..., // Exposes the reveal.js API through window.postMessage postMessage: true, // Dispatches all reveal.js events to the parent window through postMessage postMessageEvents: false }); PDF Export Presentations can be exported to PDF via a special print stylesheet. This feature requires that you use Google Chrome . Here's an example of an exported presentation that's been uploaded to SlideShare: http://www.slideshare.net/hakimel/revealjs-300. Open your presentation with print-pdf included anywhere in the query string. This triggers the default index HTML to load the PDF print stylesheet ( css/print/pdf.css ). You can test this with lab.hakim.se/reveal-js?print-pdf . Open the in-browser print dialog (CMD+P). Change the Destination setting to Save as PDF . Change the Layout to Landscape . Change the Margins to None . Click Save . Theming The framework comes with a few different themes included: black: Black background, white text, blue links (default theme) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links (default theme for reveal.js < 3.0.0) beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin white text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Each theme is available as a separate stylesheet. To change theme you will need to replace black below with your desired theme name in index.html: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/theme/black.css\" id=\"theme\"> If you want to add a theme of your own see the instructions here: /css/theme/README.md . Speaker Notes reveal.js comes with a speaker notes plugin which can be used to present per-slide notes in a separate browser window. The notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you haven't written any notes. Press the 's' key on your keyboard to open the notes window. Notes are defined by appending an <aside> element to a slide as seen below. You can add the data-markdown attribute to the aside element if you prefer writing notes using Markdown. When used locally, this feature requires that reveal.js runs from a local web server . <section> <h2>Some Slide</h2> <aside class=\"notes\"> Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard). </aside> </section> If you're using the external Markdown plugin, you can add notes with the help of a special delimiter: <section data-markdown=\"example.md\" data-separator=\"^\\n\\n\\n\" data-separator-vertical=\"^\\n\\n\" data-separator-notes=\"^Note:\"></section> # Title ## Sub-title Here is some content... Note: This will only display in the notes window. Server Side Speaker Notes In some cases it can be desirable to run notes on a separate device from the one you're presenting on. The Node.js-based notes plugin lets you do this using the same note definitions as its client side counterpart. Include the required scripts by adding the following dependencies: Reveal.initialize({ ... dependencies: [ { src: 'socket.io/socket.io.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true } ] }); Then: Install Node.js Run npm install Run node plugin/notes-server Multiplexing The multiplex plugin allows your audience to view the slides of the presentation you are controlling on their own phone, tablet or laptop. As the master presentation navigates the slides, all client presentations will update in real time. See a demo at http://revealjs.jit.su/ . The multiplex plugin needs the following 3 things to operate: Master presentation that has control Client presentations that follow the master Socket.io server to broadcast events from the master to the clients More details: Master presentation Served from a static file server accessible (preferably) only to the presenter. This need only be on your (the presenter's) computer. (It's safer to run the master presentation from your own computer, so if the venue's Internet goes down it doesn't stop the show.) An example would be to execute the following commands in the directory of your master presentation: npm install node-static static If you want to use the speaker notes plugin with your master presentation then make sure you have the speaker notes plugin configured correctly along with the configuration shown below, then execute node plugin/notes-server in the directory of your master presentation. The configuration below will cause it to connect to the socket.io server as a master, as well as launch your speaker-notes/static-file server. You can then access your master presentation at http://localhost:1947 Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... multiplex: { // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions. secret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server url: 'revealjs.jit.su:80' // Location of socket.io server }, // Don't forget to add the dependencies dependencies: [ { src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.16/socket.io.min.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true }, // and if you want speaker notes { src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true } // other dependencies... ] }); Client presentation Served from a publicly accessible static file server. Examples include: GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, Dreamhost, Akamai, etc. The more reliable, the better. Your audience can then access the client presentation via http://example.com/path/to/presentation/client/index.html , with the configuration below causing them to connect to the socket.io server as clients. Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... multiplex: { // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions. secret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server url: 'revealjs.jit.su:80' // Location of socket.io server }, // Don't forget to add the dependencies dependencies: [ { src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.16/socket.io.min.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true } // other dependencies... ] }); Socket.io server Server that receives the slideChanged events from the master presentation and broadcasts them out to the connected client presentations. This needs to be publicly accessible. You can run your own socket.io server with the commands: npm install node plugin/multiplex Or you use the socket.io server at http://revealjs.jit.su . You'll need to generate a unique secret and token pair for your master and client presentations. To do so, visit http://example.com/token , where http://example.com is the location of your socket.io server. Or if you're going to use the socket.io server at http://revealjs.jit.su , visit http://revealjs.jit.su/token . You are very welcome to point your presentations at the Socket.io server running at http://revealjs.jit.su , but availability and stability are not guaranteed. For anything mission critical I recommend you run your own server. It is simple to deploy to nodejitsu, heroku, your own environment, etc. socket.io server as file static server The socket.io server can play the role of static file server for your client presentation, as in the example at http://revealjs.jit.su . (Open http://revealjs.jit.su in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match.) Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... multiplex: { // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions. secret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server url: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server }, // Don't forget to add the dependencies dependencies: [ { src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.16/socket.io.min.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true } // other dependencies... ] It can also play the role of static file server for your master presentation and client presentations at the same time (as long as you don't want to use speaker notes). (Open http://revealjs.jit.su in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match. Navigate through the slides on the second, and the first will update to match.) This is probably not desirable, because you don't want your audience to mess with your slides while you're presenting. ;) Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... multiplex: { // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions. secret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server url: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server }, // Don't forget to add the dependencies dependencies: [ { src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.16/socket.io.min.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true } // other dependencies... ] }); Leap Motion The Leap Motion plugin lets you utilize your Leap Motion device to control basic navigation of your presentation. The gestures currently supported are: 1 to 2 fingers Pointer \u2014 Point to anything on screen. Move your finger past the device to expand the pointer. 1 hand + 3 or more fingers (left/right/up/down) Navigate through your slides. See config options to invert movements. 2 hands upwards Toggle the overview mode. Do it a second time to exit the overview. Config Options You can edit the following options: Property Default Description autoCenter true Center the pointer based on where you put your finger into the leap motions detection field. gestureDelay 500 How long to delay between gestures in milliseconds. naturalSwipe true Swipe as though you were touching a touch screen. Set to false to invert. pointerColor #00aaff The color of the pointer. pointerOpacity 0.7 The opacity of the pointer. pointerSize 15 The minimum height and width of the pointer. pointerTolerance 120 Bigger = slower pointer. Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... leap: { naturalSwipe : false, // Invert swipe gestures pointerOpacity : 0.5, // Set pointer opacity to 0.5 pointerColor : '#d80000' // Red pointer }, dependencies: [ { src: 'plugin/leap/leap.js', async: true } ] }); MathJax If you want to display math equations in your presentation you can easily do so by including this plugin. The plugin is a very thin wrapper around the MathJax library. To use it you'll need to include it as a reveal.js dependency, find our more about dependencies here . The plugin defaults to using LaTeX but that can be adjusted through the math configuration object. Note that MathJax is loaded from a remote server. If you want to use it offline you'll need to download a copy of the library and adjust the mathjax configuration value. Below is an example of how the plugin can be configured. If you don't intend to change these values you do not need to include the math config object at all. Reveal.initialize({ // other options ... math: { mathjax: 'http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js', config: 'TeX-AMS_HTML-full' // See http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/config-files.html }, dependencies: [ { src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true } ] }); Read MathJax's documentation if you need HTTPS delivery or serving of specific versions for stability. Installation The basic setup is for authoring presentations only. The full setup gives you access to all reveal.js features and plugins such as speaker notes as well as the development tasks needed to make changes to the source. Basic setup The core of reveal.js is very easy to install. You'll simply need to download a copy of this repository and open the index.html file directly in your browser. Download the latest version of reveal.js from https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases Unzip and replace the example contents in index.html with your own Open index.html in a browser to view it Full setup Some reveal.js features, like external Markdown and speaker notes, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code. Install Node.js Install Grunt Clone the reveal.js repository sh $ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git Navigate to the reveal.js folder sh $ cd reveal.js Install dependencies sh $ npm install Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes sh $ grunt serve Open http://localhost:8000 to view your presentation You can change the port by using grunt serve --port 8001 .
