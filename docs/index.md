Intermediate Microeconomics - Econ 100A - UCSC - Winter 2019

University of California Santa Cruz

Prof. Natalia Lazzati [nlazzati@ucsc.edu](nlazzati@ucsc.edu)

This is the page of the class where you will find the lectures in _printable format_ as well as in slide or presentation form. To print a page, go to the corresponding page you want to print on the left navigation menu and use standard file/print menu of your browser (or keyboard shortcuts `Command+P` or `Ctrl+P`).   
      
If you cannot visualize this page correctly from within Canvas, you can `open it in a new window or tab` using this link [https://kmlv.github.io/Econ100A/](https://kmlv.github.io/Econ100A/).

## Syllabus

The **up-to-date Syllabus** can be found here: [http://bit.ly/econ100a_s17](http://bit.ly/econ100a_s17)


## Lectures 

Printable version of the lecture slides can be found in the left navigation menu of this page ([https://kmlv.github.io/Econ100A/](https://kmlv.github.io/Econ100A/)).

Lectures slides are heavily based on the teaching materials provided by the publisher of the official textbook ("Intermediate Microeconomics" by Hal R. Varian) and my own previous materials.

1. [**Introduction** - Lecture 1](https://fengnawu.github.io/econ-final-18/S1_Introduction/)

Up-to-date reading assignments per week can be found in the last page of the [Syllabus](http://bit.ly/econ100a_s17)


## Other relevant materials and sources

I recommend you open the following links in a new tab.
 
* Lazzati & Lopez Vargas' [Intermediate Microeconomics notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clykSpEGt9y_dnYVIgZaCQFet1q2z0_enbaRtg5_C-A/). Most likely this will require you to log into google with your UCSC account.   

* Kristian's Desmos Interactive graph example: [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gui6gng3mu](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gui6gng3mu)
 
* Intermediate Microeconomics Video Handbook.- This is a resource that can only be accessed via Canvas as it requires UCSC authentication.
 
* Makler's EconGraphs.org [https://www.econgraphs.org](https://www.econgraphs.org)
